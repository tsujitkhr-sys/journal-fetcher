To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue, regardless of the presence of large vessel occlusion. This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial was conducted at 26 stroke centers across China. A total of 372 patients with acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging were enrolled between June 21, 2021, and June 30, 2024 (final follow-up October 2, 2024). Eligibility criteria included stroke onset (or the midpoint between last known well and symptom recognition if onset was unknown) of 4.5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;186) or standard medical treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;186). The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Among 372 patients who were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 160 [43%] women), all completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 75 of 186 patients (40%) in the alteplase group and 49 of 186 (26%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.14-2.02]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004; unadjusted risk difference, 13.98% [95% CI, 4.50%-23.45%]). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase at 3.8% compared with 0.51% with standard treatment (adjusted risk ratio, 7.34 [95% CI, 1.54-34.84]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01; unadjusted risk difference, 3.23% [0.28%-6.19%]), and mortality was 11% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.52-1.62]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.76; unadjusted risk difference, 0% [95% CI, -6.30% to 6.30%]). In patients with acute ischemic stroke with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset provided functional benefit, despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

To determine the most effective population health outreach strategy to promote colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 45 to 49 years. Randomized clinical trial with 20&#x202f;509 participants conducted in a large health system (UCLA Health). Primary care patients aged 45 to 49 years at average risk for colorectal cancer were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 4 outreach strategies. The trial ran May 2, 2022, to May 13, 2022, with follow-up through November 13, 2022. Colorectal cancer screening via 1 of 4 strategies: (1) fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-only active choice; (2) colonoscopy-only active choice; (3) dual-modality (FIT or colonoscopy) active choice; and (4) usual care default mailed FIT outreach. Primary outcome was participation in screening (FIT or colonoscopy) at 6 months. Secondary outcome was screening modality completed. Among 20&#x202f;509 participants (53.9% female, 4.2% Black and 50.8% non-Hispanic White; mean [SD] age, 47.4 [1.5] years), 3816 (18.6%) underwent screening. Participation was significantly lower in each of the 3 active choice groups (FIT only, 841 of 5131 [16.4%; rate difference, -9.8%; 95% CI, -11.3% to -8.2%]; colonoscopy only, 743 of 5127 [14.5%; rate difference, -11.7%; 95% CI, -13.2% to -10.1%]; dual-modality FIT or colonoscopy, 890 of 5125 [17.4%; rate difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -10.5% to -7.4%]) than in the usual care default mailed FIT group (1342 of 5126 [26.2%]; all P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Participants offered dual-modality active choice more likely completed any screening than those offered a single active choice modality (17.4% [dual-modality FIT or colonoscopy] vs 15.4% [FIT only and colonoscopy only combined]; rate difference, -1.8%; 95% CI, -3.0% to -0.1%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004]). Among 5125 participants offered a choice between 2 modalities (dual-modality active choice FIT or colonoscopy), colonoscopy was more common than FIT (616 [12.0%] vs 288 [5.6%]; rate difference, -6.4%; 95% CI, -7.5% to -5.3%; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). There was notable crossover in the FIT-only groups to colonoscopy (502 of 5131 [9.8%; FIT-only active choice] and 501 of 5126 [9.8%; usual care default mailed FIT]). Crossover from colonoscopy to FIT was modest (137 of 5127 [2.7%; colonoscopy-only active choice]). In this randomized clinical trial, 3 different active choice interventions had lower colorectal cancer screening completion rates among individuals aged 45 to 49 years compared with usual care.

To report early results from this institutional review board-approved single-group intervention study of in utero embolization for VOGM. Single-center, single-group intervention study in the US. First enrollment was on September 30, 2022; the most recent follow-up was on April 10, 2025. Eligible fetuses had VOGM, no major brain injury on fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and falcine sinus width of 7 mm or greater. Fetal embolization was ultrasound guided, using transuterine, transcranial needle access and microcatheterization of the prosencephalic venous varix with detachable coils. In utero embolization of fetuses with VOGM. Neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Pre- and postembolization fetal magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography were performed. Seven patients were enrolled; 5 underwent successful embolization. The mean maternal age was 32.4 years (range, 22-36); the mean fetal gestational age was 35 6/7 weeks (range, 33 6/7 to 37 1/7); and the sex ratio was 3:4 (female to male). The mean falcine diameter (10.3 mm) corresponded to 90% expected mortality and 9% likelihood of reaching 6-month milestones with standard postnatal care. Overall mortality was 43%, and 43% were meeting milestones at 6 months. Three embolized patients (aged 8, 18, and 24 months) survived, all without neurodevelopmental delay. Four of the 7 patients underwent additional neonatal embolization. Fetal echocardiography showed a mean 33.4% reduction (range, 16%-46%) in cardiac output. Five of 7 patients (71.4%) had unscheduled deliveries and 3 of these 5 were preterm, at a mean of 3.2 days after intervention. Early results demonstrate the feasibility of fetal embolization. Any potential reduction in mortality, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delays must be weighed against an increased risk of unscheduled, preterm delivery.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin vs standard therapy for completion of treatment of complicated S aureus bacteremia. Open-label, assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 2021 to December 2023 at 23 medical centers in the US (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and Canada (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Participant follow-up lasted 70 days (180 days for participants with osteomyelitis); date of final follow-up was December 1, 2023. Hospitalized adults with complicated S aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance following at least 72 hours but no more than 10 days of initial antibacterial therapy were included. Participants were excluded if they had central nervous system infection, retained infected prosthetic material, left-sided endocarditis, or severe immune compromise. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2 doses of intravenous dalbavancin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100; 1500 mg on days 1 and 8) or 4 to 8 total weeks of standard intravenous therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100; cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillin if methicillin susceptible; vancomycin or daptomycin if methicillin resistant). The primary outcome was the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) at day 70, which involved 5 components (clinical success, infectious complications, safety complications, mortality, and health-related quality of life) and was assessed for superiority (achieved if the 95% CI for the probability of dalbavancin having a superior DOOR was &gt;50%). Secondary outcomes included clinical efficacy at day 70 (prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%) and safety. Of 200 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 56 [16.2] years; 62 females [31%]), 167 (84%) survived to day 70 and had an efficacy assessment. Participants without a day 70 efficacy assessment were treated as clinical failures in the analyses. The probability of a more desirable day 70 outcome with dalbavancin vs standard therapy was 47.7% (95% CI, 39.8% to 55.7%). Regarding secondary outcomes, clinical efficacy was documented in 73 of 100 for dalbavancin and 72 of 100 for standard therapy (difference, 1.0% [95% CI, -11.5% to 13.5%]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. Serious adverse events were reported in 40 of 100 participants who received dalbavancin and 34 of 100 participants who received standard therapy; treatment-related adverse events were uncommon in both groups. Among adult participants with complicated S aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance, dalbavancin was not superior to standard therapy by desirability of outcome ranking. When considered with other efficacy and safety outcomes these findings may help inform use of dalbavancin in clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04775953."

A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial at 13 stroke units and centers and 11 collaborating rehabilitation centers in Switzerland. Between June 14, 2019 (first patient, first visit), and August 27, 2024 (last patient, last visit), 610 patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with clinically meaningful hemiparesis (ie, a total score of &#x2265;3 points on the following National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale items: motor arm, motor leg, or limb ataxia) were randomized 1:1 to receive levodopa or placebo. Statistical analyses were conducted from November 2024 to August 2025. Patients received levodopa/carbidopa (100 mg/25 mg; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;307) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;303) 3 times daily for 39 days, alongside standardized rehabilitation therapy based on active task-oriented training. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean between-group difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) total score (range, 0-100 points; fewer points indicate worse motor function; 6-point difference considered patient-relevant) at 3 months. Among the 610 participants (median [IQR] age, 73 [64-82] years; 252 [41.3%] female; median baseline FMA total score, 34 [14-54]), 28 participants died by 3 months, leaving 582 (95.4%) participants eligible for the primary analysis. At 3 months, the median (IQR) FMA total score was 68 (42-85) points in the levodopa group and 64 (44-83) points in the placebo group. The mean difference in the FMA total score between the levodopa and placebo groups was -0.90 points (95% CI, -3.78 to 1.98; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.54).

The development included (1) a systematic review of reporting practices in published studies that had explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial; (2) a 2-round online survey (August 2023 to March 2024; 18 expert participants from 6 countries) to assess the importance of candidate items selected from previous research and to identify additional items; (3) a 3-day expert consensus meeting (June 2024; 18 panelists) to refine the scope of the guideline and draft the checklist; and (4) pilot of the draft checklist with stakeholders (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;108; September 2024 to February 2025). The checklist was further refined based on feedback on successive drafts. The 21-item TARGET checklist is organized into 6 sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, other information). TARGET provides guidance for reporting observational studies of interventions explicitly emulating a parallel group, individually randomized target trial, with adjustment for baseline confounders. Key recommendations are to (1) identify the study as an observational emulation of a target trial; (2) summarize the causal question and reason for emulating a target trial, (3) clearly specify the target trial protocol (ie, the causal estimand, identifying assumptions, data analysis plan) and how it was mapped to the observational data, and (4) report the estimate obtained for each causal estimand, its precision, and findings from additional analyses to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to assumptions, and design and analysis choices. Application of the TARGET guideline recommendations aims to improve reporting transparency and peer review and help researchers, clinicians, and other readers interpret and apply the results."

However, the extent of children's interactions with Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and their experience of uninsurance over 18 years of childhood remains unclear. Such estimates can provide a baseline for gauging the potential impact of upcoming Medicaid policy changes. To estimate insurance dynamics in relation to Medicaid or CHIP and uninsurance over childhood under post-Affordable Care Act (ACA) prepandemic policy conditions. Using a microsimulation model, we projected individual-level monthly insurance coverage (Medicaid or CHIP, Marketplace, employment-based, other, or uninsured) from birth until the 18th birthday for a simulated nationally representative cohort of 100&#x202f;000 US children. National data were synthesized (2015-2019), including natality records, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey pooled 2-year panels, and 1 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 3-year panel. Monthly insurance status was simulated by matching dynamically updated predictors to SIPP samples every 12 months. Predictors included annual family income as a percentage of the federal poverty level, insurance history, state, and age. The analysis was bootstrapped 1000 times to generate 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI). Insurance status and state of residence at birth. Cumulative insurance experience, overall and by subgroup. It was estimated that, by their 18th birthday, 61% (95% UI, 58%-63%) of US children were ever enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and 42% (95% UI, 38%-46%) were ever uninsured. An estimated 26% (95% UI, 24%-29%) of children were continuously enrolled in employment-based or other insurance excluding Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace. Among children born with Medicaid or CHIP, the share ever uninsured was 59% (95% UI, 48%-66%) in ACA nonexpansion states vs 36% (95% UI, 30%-41%) in expansion states. Across alternative categorizations of policy restrictiveness, the highest share of ever uninsured among children born with Medicaid or CHIP was consistently estimated in states with the most restrictive Medicaid and CHIP eligibility criteria. An estimated 3 of 4 US children relied on publicly subsidized insurance (Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace) or experienced a period without any insurance by their 18th birthday in the post-ACA, prepandemic policy environment. Substantial state heterogeneity in childhood uninsurance underscores the critical role of Medicaid policies."
