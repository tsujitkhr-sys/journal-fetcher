      "abstract_md": "The safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolytics beyond 4.5 hours after ischemic stroke onset remain inadequately studied. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue, regardless of the presence of large vessel occlusion. This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial was conducted at 26 stroke centers across China. A total of 372 patients with acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging were enrolled between June 21, 2021, and June 30, 2024 (final follow-up October 2, 2024). Eligibility criteria included stroke onset (or the midpoint between last known well and symptom recognition if onset was unknown) of 4.5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;186) or standard medical treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;186). The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Among 372 patients who were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 160 [43%] women), all completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 75 of 186 patients (40%) in the alteplase group and 49 of 186 (26%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.14-2.02]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004; unadjusted risk difference, 13.98% [95% CI, 4.50%-23.45%]). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase at 3.8% compared with 0.51% with standard treatment (adjusted risk ratio, 7.34 [95% CI, 1.54-34.84]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01; unadjusted risk difference, 3.23% [0.28%-6.19%]), and mortality was 11% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.52-1.62]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.76; unadjusted risk difference, 0% [95% CI, -6.30% to 6.30%]). In patients with acute ischemic stroke with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset provided functional benefit, despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

      "abstract_md": "Up to 40% of men older than 50 years have lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary urgency, nocturia, and weak urinary stream, due to disorders of the bladder and prostate. These symptoms negatively affect quality of life and may be associated with urinary retention, which can cause kidney insufficiency, bladder calculi, hematuria, and urinary tract infections. In men, lower urinary tract symptoms can be caused by bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an overactive bladder detrusor (a syndrome of urinary urgency and frequency), or both. Behavioral therapy, including pelvic floor physical therapy, timed voiding (voiding at specific intervals), and fluid restriction, can improve symptoms. Medications including &#x3b1;-blockers (such as tamsulosin), 5&#x3b1;-reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride), and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (such as tadalafil) improve lower urinary tract symptoms (mean improvement, 3-10 points on the International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS], which ranges from 0-35, with higher scores indicating greater severity) and can prevent symptom worsening measured by increased IPSS greater than or equal to 4 points or development of secondary sequelae, such as urinary retention. Combination therapies are more effective than monotherapy. For example, &#x3b1;-blockade (eg, tamsulosin) combined with 5&#x3b1;-reductase inhibition (eg, finasteride) lowers progression risk to less than 10% compared with 10% to 15% with monotherapy. Treatment for overactive bladder detrusor muscle, including anticholinergics (eg, trospium) and &#x3b2;3 agonists (eg, mirabegron), reduces voiding frequency by 2 to 4 times per day and reduces episodes of urinary incontinence by 10 to 20 times per week. Surgery (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate, holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) and minimally invasive surgery are highly effective for refractory or complicated cases of BPH, defined as persistent symptoms despite behavioral and pharmacologic therapy, and these therapies can improve IPSS by 10 to 15 points. Minimally invasive procedures, such as water vapor therapy (endoscopic injection of steam into BPH tissue) and prostatic urethral lift (endoscopic insertion of nonabsorbable suture implants that mechanically open the urethra), have lower complication rates of incontinence (0%-8%), erectile dysfunction (0%-3%), and retrograde ejaculation (0%-3%) but are associated with increased need for surgical retreatment (3.4%-21%) compared with transurethral resection of the prostate (5%) and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (3.3%). Lower urinary tract symptoms, defined as urinary urgency, nocturia, or weak stream, are common among men and are usually caused by BPH, overactive bladder detrusor, or both. First-line therapy consists of behavioral interventions, such as pelvic floor physical therapy and timed voiding, as well as pharmacologic therapy, including &#x3b1;-adrenergic blockers (tamsulosin), 5&#x3b1;-reductase inhibitors (finasteride), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (tadalafil), anticholinergics (trospium), and &#x3b2;3 agonists (mirabegron)."

      "abstract_md": "Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of death from bacteremia worldwide, with a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and an estimated 300&#x202f;000 deaths per year. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis (&#x2248;12%), septic arthritis (7%), vertebral osteomyelitis (&#x2248;4%), spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices. Patients with S aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia (&#x2265;48 hours) is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%. All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) based on susceptibility to &#x3b2;-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA. Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care (treatment success, 53/120 [44%] vs 48/115 [42%]) and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin (treatment success, 132/189 [70%] vs 136/198 [69%]). Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and causes 300&#x202f;000 deaths per year worldwide. Empirical antibiotic treatment should include vancomycin or daptomycin, which are active against MRSA. Once S aureus susceptibilities are known, MSSA should be treated with cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Additional clinical management consists of identifying sites of metastatic infection and pursuing source control for identified foci of infection."

Colorectal cancer screening via 1 of 4 strategies: (1) fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-only active choice; (2) colonoscopy-only active choice; (3) dual-modality (FIT or colonoscopy) active choice; and (4) usual care default mailed FIT outreach. Primary outcome was participation in screening (FIT or colonoscopy) at 6 months. Secondary outcome was screening modality completed. Among 20&#x202f;509 participants (53.9% female, 4.2% Black and 50.8% non-Hispanic White; mean [SD] age, 47.4 [1.5] years), 3816 (18.6%) underwent screening. Participation was significantly lower in each of the 3 active choice groups (FIT only, 841 of 5131 [16.4%; rate difference, -9.8%; 95% CI, -11.3% to -8.2%]; colonoscopy only, 743 of 5127 [14.5%; rate difference, -11.7%; 95% CI, -13.2% to -10.1%]; dual-modality FIT or colonoscopy, 890 of 5125 [17.4%; rate difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -10.5% to -7.4%]) than in the usual care default mailed FIT group (1342 of 5126 [26.2%]; all P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Participants offered dual-modality active choice more likely completed any screening than those offered a single active choice modality (17.4% [dual-modality FIT or colonoscopy] vs 15.4% [FIT only and colonoscopy only combined]; rate difference, -1.8%; 95% CI, -3.0% to -0.1%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004]). Among 5125 participants offered a choice between 2 modalities (dual-modality active choice FIT or colonoscopy), colonoscopy was more common than FIT (616 [12.0%] vs 288 [5.6%]; rate difference, -6.4%; 95% CI, -7.5% to -5.3%; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). There was notable crossover in the FIT-only groups to colonoscopy (502 of 5131 [9.8%; FIT-only active choice] and 501 of 5126 [9.8%; usual care default mailed FIT]). Crossover from colonoscopy to FIT was modest (137 of 5127 [2.7%; colonoscopy-only active choice]). In this randomized clinical trial, 3 different active choice interventions had lower colorectal cancer screening completion rates among individuals aged 45 to 49 years compared with usual care.

      "abstract_md": "Hypothyroidism is a disease of thyroid hormone deficiency. The prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 12% worldwide, depending on iodine intake, and it is more common in women and older adults. Untreated hypothyroidism can cause serious health complications such as heart failure and myxedema coma. Hashimoto thyroiditis (an autoimmune disease) is the cause of primary hypothyroidism in up to 85% of patients with hypothyroidism living in areas with adequate nutritional iodine levels. The risk of developing hypothyroidism is associated with genetic factors (having a first-degree relative with hypothyroidism), environmental factors (iodine deficiency), undergoing neck surgery or receiving radiation therapy, pregnancy in the setting of underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, and with the use of certain medications (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and amiodarone). Patients with hypothyroidism may have nonspecific symptoms due to metabolic slowing, including fatigue (68%-83%), weight gain (24%-59%), cognitive issues (45%-48%) such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating, and menstrual irregularities (approximately 23%) such as oligomenorrhea and menorrhagia. Hypothyroidism can cause insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, increase the risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, and negatively affect female reproductive health, causing disrupted ovulation, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Untreated hypothyroidism may progress to severe hypothyroidism with decompensation (myxedema coma), which is a condition associated with hypothermia, hypotension, and altered mental status that requires treatment in an intensive care unit and has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed based on biochemical testing; a high thyrotropin (TSH) level and a low free thyroxine (T4) level indicate overt primary hypothyroidism. Screening for hypothyroidism is not recommended for asymptomatic individuals. Targeted testing is recommended for patients who are considered high risk (eg, patients with type 1 diabetes). First-line treatment for hypothyroidism is synthetic levothyroxine to normalize thyrotropin levels. Initial dosages should be tailored to patient-specific factors. Lower starting doses should be used for older patients or those with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. Thyrotropin monitoring should be performed 6 to 8 weeks after initiating levothyroxine treatment, or when changing the dose, and then annually once the thyrotropin level is at goal to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment, both of which are associated with cardiovascular health risks. Hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue, weight gain, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, cardiovascular disease such as heart failure, menstrual irregularities, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Levothyroxine is the first-line treatment to normalize the thyrotropin level and improve clinical manifestations due to hypothyroidism."

      "abstract_md": "Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass, increased bone fragility, and increased susceptibility to fracture, which is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. Worldwide, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men older than 50 years of age experience osteoporotic fractures in their lifetime. Risk factors for osteoporosis include older age, female sex, prior fractures, prior falls, low body weight, history of hip fracture in a parent, glucocorticoid use, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol consumption, certain comorbidities (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic liver and kidney disease), and low level of bone mineral density (BMD; measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). The fracture risk assessment algorithm combines these clinical risk factors and BMD measurement to estimate the 10-year absolute fracture risk for hip, spine, shoulder, and forearm fractures. For patients at high risk of fracture, such as those with a T score of -2.5 or less (equivalent to a bone mass that is &#x2265;2.5 SDs below that of young adults) for BMD, history of vertebral or hip fracture, multiple fractures, or high 10-year absolute fracture risk (eg, &#x2265;20%), antiresorptive agents (bisphosphonates or, if contraindicated, denosumab) are recommended to reduce vertebral fractures (risk difference, -52 [95% CI, -95 to -18 per 1000 person-years]) and hip fractures (risk difference, -6 [95% CI, -11 to -1 per 1000 person-years]). Anabolic medications (teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab) should be considered in very high-risk individuals (eg, recent vertebral fractures, hip fracture with a T score of &#x2264;-2.5 for BMD), followed by an antiresorptive agent. The use of fracture liaison services (comprehensive inpatient or outpatient management program for patients after a fracture) was shown to increase medication initiation and adherence by 38% compared with 17% for patients who did not receive fracture liaison services (risk difference, 20% [95% CI, 16% to 25%]) and these benefits may reduce the rates of subsequent fracture. Patients are recommended to follow appropriate intake of calcium (1000 to 1200 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU) guidelines and to pursue a regimen of muscle resistance exercises (eg, squats, push-ups) and balance exercises (eg, heel raises, standing on 1 foot). Osteoporosis is a common condition among older adults that leads to increased susceptibility to fracture, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates or denosumab are recommended for patients at high fracture risk. Anabolic treatment with parathyroid hormone analogs (such as teriparatide and abaloparatide) and sclerostin inhibitors (such as romosozumab) can be considered for very high-risk individuals."

      "abstract_md": "Vein of Galen malformation (VOGM) is the most common congenital cerebrovascular anomaly. Fetuses with VOGM and wide mediolateral falcine sinus diameters are at high risk for mortality, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delay. In utero embolization may improve survival and outcomes. To report early results from this institutional review board-approved single-group intervention study of in utero embolization for VOGM. Single-center, single-group intervention study in the US. First enrollment was on September 30, 2022; the most recent follow-up was on April 10, 2025. Eligible fetuses had VOGM, no major brain injury on fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and falcine sinus width of 7 mm or greater. Fetal embolization was ultrasound guided, using transuterine, transcranial needle access and microcatheterization of the prosencephalic venous varix with detachable coils. In utero embolization of fetuses with VOGM. Neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Pre- and postembolization fetal magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography were performed. Seven patients were enrolled; 5 underwent successful embolization. The mean maternal age was 32.4 years (range, 22-36); the mean fetal gestational age was 35 6/7 weeks (range, 33 6/7 to 37 1/7); and the sex ratio was 3:4 (female to male). The mean falcine diameter (10.3 mm) corresponded to 90% expected mortality and 9% likelihood of reaching 6-month milestones with standard postnatal care. Overall mortality was 43%, and 43% were meeting milestones at 6 months. Three embolized patients (aged 8, 18, and 24 months) survived, all without neurodevelopmental delay. Four of the 7 patients underwent additional neonatal embolization. Fetal echocardiography showed a mean 33.4% reduction (range, 16%-46%) in cardiac output. Five of 7 patients (71.4%) had unscheduled deliveries and 3 of these 5 were preterm, at a mean of 3.2 days after intervention. Early results demonstrate the feasibility of fetal embolization. Any potential reduction in mortality, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delays must be weighed against an increased risk of unscheduled, preterm delivery.

      "abstract_md": "Mental health challenges among physicians represent a critical public health issue with profound implications for health care delivery and workforce sustainability. Despite the proven effectiveness of mental health treatment in improving outcomes, most physicians with mental health conditions do not seek help. This treatment gap is particularly concerning given that physicians experience elevated rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk compared with the general population, with resulting effects on physician well-being, patient care quality, and health care system stability. Barriers to accessing mental health care services among physicians stem from multiple interrelated factors. Medical culture normalizes inadequate self-care and high levels of distress while stigmatizing mental health conditions. Real and perceived professional consequences, including career limitations and increased scrutiny, further deter individuals from seeking help. Other barriers include logistical challenges to seeking help, inflexible schedules, and a profound desire for confidentiality. Addressing these barriers requires comprehensive initiatives spanning education, programming, and policy reform. Major national organizations are elevating evidence-informed solutions, including leadership-driven initiatives that normalize seeking help, organizational policies that provide structural support for accessing care, and legislative reforms that protect confidentiality and reduce discriminatory practices in licensing and credentialing. Although multiple interventions are needed to address physician mental health, eliminating barriers to care represents a critical and actionable opportunity to reduce the alarming rates of untreated conditions and prevent physician suicides. The most urgent priority is closing the implementation gap by universally adopting proven strategies, such as removing intrusive licensing and credentialing questions and expanding confidential care options. A sustained commitment to this work, coupled with thoughtful exploration of future innovations, is essential to support physician well-being and optimize high-quality patient care."

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin vs standard therapy for completion of treatment of complicated S aureus bacteremia. Open-label, assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 2021 to December 2023 at 23 medical centers in the US (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and Canada (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Participant follow-up lasted 70 days (180 days for participants with osteomyelitis); date of final follow-up was December 1, 2023. Hospitalized adults with complicated S aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance following at least 72 hours but no more than 10 days of initial antibacterial therapy were included. Participants were excluded if they had central nervous system infection, retained infected prosthetic material, left-sided endocarditis, or severe immune compromise. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2 doses of intravenous dalbavancin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100; 1500 mg on days 1 and 8) or 4 to 8 total weeks of standard intravenous therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100; cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillin if methicillin susceptible; vancomycin or daptomycin if methicillin resistant). The primary outcome was the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) at day 70, which involved 5 components (clinical success, infectious complications, safety complications, mortality, and health-related quality of life) and was assessed for superiority (achieved if the 95% CI for the probability of dalbavancin having a superior DOOR was &gt;50%). Secondary outcomes included clinical efficacy at day 70 (prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%) and safety. Of 200 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 56 [16.2] years; 62 females [31%]), 167 (84%) survived to day 70 and had an efficacy assessment. Participants without a day 70 efficacy assessment were treated as clinical failures in the analyses. The probability of a more desirable day 70 outcome with dalbavancin vs standard therapy was 47.7% (95% CI, 39.8% to 55.7%). Regarding secondary outcomes, clinical efficacy was documented in 73 of 100 for dalbavancin and 72 of 100 for standard therapy (difference, 1.0% [95% CI, -11.5% to 13.5%]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. Serious adverse events were reported in 40 of 100 participants who received dalbavancin and 34 of 100 participants who received standard therapy; treatment-related adverse events were uncommon in both groups. Among adult participants with complicated S aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance, dalbavancin was not superior to standard therapy by desirability of outcome ranking. When considered with other efficacy and safety outcomes these findings may help inform use of dalbavancin in clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04775953."

      "abstract_md": "Superficial vein thrombosis (SuVT) is characterized by thrombus in the superficial veins, typically in the lower or upper extremities, and has an estimated annual incidence of 64 to 131 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years. Approximately 10% of patients with SuVT progress to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Endothelial injury (caused by infection or intravenous devices), venous stasis (such as from chronic venous insufficiency or prolonged immobility), and hypercoagulability (due to cancer or pregnancy) are pathophysiologic factors associated with SuVT. Clinical risk factors for lower extremity SuVT are similar to those of DVT and PE and include pregnancy, varicose veins, and active cancer. The incidence of SuVT is greater in females than males (78-167 compared with 49-116 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years). In contrast with lower extremity SuVT, upper extremity SuVT is primarily caused by indwelling intravenous catheters. Patients typically present with a tender, red, palpable cord under the skin in the upper or lower extremity. D-dimer testing has a sensitivity of approximately 48% to 74.3% and, therefore, is not reliable for excluding SuVT. Approximately 25% of patients with lower extremity SuVT present with concomitant DVT, likely because risk factors for SuVT and DVT are similar and because SuVT can extend into deep veins. In people without classic symptoms and signs of SuVT, ultrasonography can establish the presence and extent of the thrombus. Management may include elastic compression stockings and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For patients with SuVTs that are at least 5 cm long or those with persistent or worsening symptoms despite several days of conservative therapy, treatment includes anticoagulation with fondaparinux 2.5 mg. Alternative anticoagulation treatment includes rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily and low-molecular-weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg once daily), which may reduce subsequent venous thromboembolic events. SuVT located within 3 cm of a deep vein should be treated with therapeutic doses of anticoagulation such as direct oral anticoagulants. SuVT typically presents as a tender, painful, palpable cord under the skin. Management may include elastic compression stockings, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and systemic anticoagulation with fondaparinux 2.5 mg or rivaroxaban 10 mg. SuVTs within 3 cm of a deep vein should be treated with therapeutic dose anticoagulation."

      "abstract_md": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps causes severe symptoms and impaired quality of life. Stapokibart is a novel monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin 4R&#x3b1;. To assess the efficacy and safety of stapokibart as an add-on treatment to intranasal corticosteroids in patients with severe uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. From August 9, 2022, to April 28, 2023, this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial, conducted at 51 hospitals in China, enrolled adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who had a history of systemic corticosteroid use or sinonasal surgery and a bilateral nasal polyp score of 5 or greater (on a scale of 0-8) and a weekly mean nasal congestion score of 2 or greater (on a scale of 0-3). Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps was defined as blood eosinophils of 6.9% or greater (without asthma) or 3.7% or greater (with asthma) or an eosinophil count of 55 per high-power field or greater or 27% or greater in nasal polyp tissue. Patient follow-up was completed on June 25, 2024. Four weeks after initiation of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 100 &#xb5;g in each nostril daily, patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous stapokibart, 300 mg, or placebo (1:1) every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Both groups then received stapokibart for 28 weeks. Co-primary end points were changes from baseline in nasal polyp score (meaningful change threshold [MCT] &#x2265;1 point) and nasal congestion score (MCT &#x2265;0.5 points) at week 24 in all patients and in the population with eosinophilia. Among 180 patients randomized, 179 (mean age, 45 [SD, 12.9] years; 61 [34.1%] women) received at least 1 treatment dose (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;90 for stapokibart; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;89 for placebo). In the overall population, the least-squares (LS) mean change in nasal polyp score from baseline to week 24 in the stapokibart vs placebo groups was -2.6 vs -0.3 points, respectively, (LS mean difference, -2.3; 95% CI, -2.6 to -1.9; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001); in the population with eosinophilia, the change was -3.0 vs -0.4 points, respectively (LS mean difference, -2.5; 95% CI, -2.9 to -2.1; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The LS mean change in nasal congestion score from baseline to week 24 in the stapokibart vs placebo groups was -1.2 vs -0.5 points, respectively, in the overall population (LS mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -0.9 to -0.5; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and -1.3 vs -0.5 points, respectively, in the population with eosinophilia (LS mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.6; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Serious adverse events were rare (2.2% in the stapokibart group vs 1.1% in the placebo group). Higher rates of arthralgia (7.8% vs 0%) and hyperuricemia (5.6% vs 1.1%) were reported with stapokibart vs placebo, respectively. Among patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps treated with a daily intranasal corticosteroid, stapokibart reduced polyp size and severity of nasal symptoms at 24 weeks.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab incorporated into induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy, without concurrent cisplatin, for locoregionally advanced NPC. Open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 clinical trial conducted from August 2021 to July 2022 at 13 hospitals in China, enrolling 532 patients with T4N1M0 or T1-4N2-3M0 NPC; 400 (75.2%) completed the trial per protocol.

Patients were randomly assigned to either the standard therapy group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;266), receiving toripalimab with gemcitabine-cisplatin induction chemotherapy and concurrent cisplatin-radiotherapy (100 mg/m2 triweekly for 2 cycles), or the concurrent cisplatin-sparing group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;266), receiving the same regimen without concurrent cisplatin. The 17 cycles of toripalimab (240 mg triweekly) were distributed across the induction, radiotherapy, and adjuvant phases as 3, 3, and 11 cycles, respectively. Coprimary end points were failure-free survival (noninferiority margin, 8%) and incidence of all-grade vomiting (superiority design). Secondary end points included overall survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, safety, tumor response, quality of life, and tolerability. In the 532 patients in the intention-to-treat population (median [IQR] age, 47 [39-54] years; 25.2% women), after a median follow-up of 37.0 (range, 4.0-50.0) months, the concurrent cisplatin-sparing group had a 3-year failure-free survival rate of 88.3% vs 87.6% in the standard therapy group, a difference of 0.7% (lower limit of the 1-sided 95% CI, -3.9%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002 for noninferiority; stratified hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.66-1.79]; log-rank P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.73). In the safety analysis, the incidence of all-grade vomiting was significantly lower in the concurrent cisplatin-sparing group vs the standard therapy group (26.2% [68/260] vs 59.8% [156/261]; difference, 33.6% [1-sided 95% CI, 26.9%-&#x221e;]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Patient-reported quality of life (participation rate, 87.5%) and tolerability (participation rate, 94.7%) were better in the concurrent cisplatin-sparing group, primarily in gastrointestinal, functional, and global health status. In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, among patients with locoregionally advanced NPC, toripalimab combination therapy without concurrent cisplatin was a feasible treatment with high efficacy in failure-free survival and low toxicity.

      "abstract_md": "Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime. Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0-43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is &#x3b1;-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; &#x394;NIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;-10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; &#x394;NIH-CPSI score difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (&#x394;NIH-CPSI score difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.4), and pollen extract (&#x394;NIH-CPSI score difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.49). Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and &#x3b1;-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms."

      "abstract_md": "Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic &#x3b2; cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C &lt;7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%. Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications."

      "abstract_md": "Levodopa enhances dopaminergic signaling and may stimulate neuroplasticity, which could potentially enhance motor recovery after stroke. Levodopa is used in stroke rehabilitation despite mixed evidence for its effectiveness. To determine whether levodopa compared with placebo, administered in addition to standardized rehabilitation based on active task-oriented training, is associated with enhanced motor recovery in patients with acute stroke. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial at 13 stroke units and centers and 11 collaborating rehabilitation centers in Switzerland. Between June 14, 2019 (first patient, first visit), and August 27, 2024 (last patient, last visit), 610 patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with clinically meaningful hemiparesis (ie, a total score of &#x2265;3 points on the following National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale items: motor arm, motor leg, or limb ataxia) were randomized 1:1 to receive levodopa or placebo. Statistical analyses were conducted from November 2024 to August 2025. Patients received levodopa/carbidopa (100 mg/25 mg; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;307) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;303) 3 times daily for 39 days, alongside standardized rehabilitation therapy based on active task-oriented training. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean between-group difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) total score (range, 0-100 points; fewer points indicate worse motor function; 6-point difference considered patient-relevant) at 3 months. Among the 610 participants (median [IQR] age, 73 [64-82] years; 252 [41.3%] female; median baseline FMA total score, 34 [14-54]), 28 participants died by 3 months, leaving 582 (95.4%) participants eligible for the primary analysis. At 3 months, the median (IQR) FMA total score was 68 (42-85) points in the levodopa group and 64 (44-83) points in the placebo group. The mean difference in the FMA total score between the levodopa and placebo groups was -0.90 points (95% CI, -3.78 to 1.98; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.54). There were 126 serious adverse events in the levodopa group and 129 in the placebo group; the most common was infection (levodopa, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55; placebo, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;44). In this randomized clinical trial, among patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation for acute stroke, levodopa added to standardized rehabilitation did not significantly improve motor function at 3 months compared with placebo plus standardized rehabilitation. These results do not support the use of levodopa as an adjunct to rehabilitation therapy for enhancing motor recovery after acute stroke. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03735901."

Geroscience is a relatively new discipline that aims to define and modify aging-related biologic pathways, slow age-related disability, prevent age-related diseases, and increase disability-free survival. Medical therapies typically alter biologic pathways to treat or prevent specific diseases. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are cholesterol-lowering medications used to prevent development and progression of atherosclerosis. However, disease-focused treatments do not alter aging's effects on disease and declining function (eg, statins do not significantly reduce noncardiovascular mortality or cancer). In animal models, treatments can alter aging's effect on disease. For example, in mice, caloric restriction increases mean lifespan from 10% to 40% compared with mice fed ad libitum and favorably affects multiple cellular pathways implicated in aging including nutrient sensing, protein synthesis, autophagy, and inflammation. In adults with obesity and diabetes, compared with non-caloric restriction intervention groups, randomization to receive caloric restriction was associated with a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality and a lower incidence of weight-related chronic diseases. Rapamycin, a drug approved to suppress posttransplant organ rejection, increased mouse median lifespan by 249 days in females and 154 days in males. A rapamycin analogue, everolimus, improved antibody titers to influenza vaccine in older adults. In humans, senescent cells increase in abundance with age and are characterized by growth arrest, apoptosis resistance, and an altered secretome (the set of proteins secreted by a cell into the extracellular space). A greater abundance of senescent cells is associated with more physical impairments and increased mortality. Reducing the number of these cells in animal models extends lifespan and improves physical function, such as grip strength and mobility, and cardiac ejection fraction. However, potential health benefits of reducing senescent cells in humans remain unclear. Therapies that inhibit aging biology, such as caloric restriction, metformin, senolytics, or rapalogs, may slow the development and progression of disease and functional decline in humans."

To describe the early experience and assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of partial heart transplant in patients with congenital heart valve disease. Case series of the first 19 patients to undergo partial heart transplant at a single high-volume pediatric cardiac surgery and transplant center in the US between April 2022 and December 2024. No patients were excluded or lost to follow-up. Partial heart transplant using semilunar valves from donor hearts. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus monotherapy with a trough level goal of 4 to 8 ng/mL. Efficacy was defined as growth of the transplanted valve annulus and leaflets over time. Secondary outcomes included valve dysfunction and complications related to immunosuppression. Among the 19 participants with irreparable congenital heart valve dysfunction, 53% were male and 47% female. The median age at the time of transplant was 97 days. The median follow-up was 26 weeks. Three patients received partial heart transplant of both semilunar valves, 7 underwent living pulmonary valve replacement in the pulmonary position, 2 had a living aortic valve allograft in the aortic position, and 7 had a living aortic valve allograft in the pulmonary position. Nine patients constituting the initial cohort of partial heart transplant recipients had their annular diameter and valve leaflet length longitudinally analyzed for growth. All valves functioned well and demonstrated growth along appropriate z scores. Annular diameter increased from medians of 7 mm (aortic valve) and 9 mm (pulmonary valve) to 14 mm (aortic valve) and 17 mm (pulmonary valve), respectively. Leaflet length similarly increased from medians of 0.5 mm (aortic valve) and 0.49 mm (pulmonary valve) to 1 mm (aortic valve) and 0.675 mm (pulmonary valve), respectively. One patient required reoperation unrelated to the implanted valve. No significant complications related to immunosuppression were observed. Partial heart transplant appears feasible, safe, and efficacious. All transplanted valves demonstrated growth based on annular and leaflet length measurements. Careful follow-up and monitoring are crucial to support the continued expansion of this novel technique."

To assess the effectiveness of a fall prevention program integrated in primary health care systems on the risk of falls among Chinese rural older adults. A 12-month, open-label, cluster randomized clinical trial, conducted in 128 rural villages from 4 Chinese provinces, involving adults 60 years or older at risk of falls (recruitment from September 19, 2023, to November 15, 2023; last follow-up, January 15, 2025). The fall prevention intervention, consisting of balance and functional exercises and community-engaged health education, was integrated with the rural primary health care system. The control group received usual care, health education alone, without active involvement with the communities. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported at least 1 fall in 12 months following the intervention. Six secondary outcomes included the rate of falls, 3 measures of functional mobility, the proportion of participants who reported fall-related injury, and health-related quality of life. Fall-related data were collected via quarterly participant self-reports supported by a calendar; functional mobility was measured at baseline and 12-month follow-up using validated measures. Of the 2616 participants recruited, 6 died before randomization and 2610 (median age, 70.0 years [IQR, 66.4-74.2]; 1553 female [59.5%]) were randomized either to the intervention group (1311 from 64 villages) or to the control group (1299 from 64 villages). During a mean follow-up of 358.0 (SD, 31.3) days, 388 participants (29.7%) in the intervention group reported falling at least once during the 12-month follow-up compared with 497 (38.3%) in the control group (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.91; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). All secondary outcomes favored the intervention except the Timed Up and Go Test (for functional mobility), which showed no significant difference. This cluster randomized trial found that integrating a fall prevention program in a primary health care system was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of self-reported falls among Chinese rural older people. This intervention, comprising balance and functional exercises and community-engaged health education, has the potential to be scaled-up in China and other low- and middle-income countries with rapidly growing aging populations.

Published guidance to aid reporting of these studies is not available. To develop consensus-based guidance for reporting observational studies performed to estimate causal effects by explicitly emulating a target trial. The Transparent Reporting of Observational Studies Emulating a Target Trial (TARGET) guideline was developed using the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) framework. The development included (1) a systematic review of reporting practices in published studies that had explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial; (2) a 2-round online survey (August 2023 to March 2024; 18 expert participants from 6 countries) to assess the importance of candidate items selected from previous research and to identify additional items; (3) a 3-day expert consensus meeting (June 2024; 18 panelists) to refine the scope of the guideline and draft the checklist; and (4) pilot of the draft checklist with stakeholders (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;108; September 2024 to February 2025). The checklist was further refined based on feedback on successive drafts. The 21-item TARGET checklist is organized into 6 sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, other information). TARGET provides guidance for reporting observational studies of interventions explicitly emulating a parallel group, individually randomized target trial, with adjustment for baseline confounders. Key recommendations are to (1) identify the study as an observational emulation of a target trial; (2) summarize the causal question and reason for emulating a target trial, (3) clearly specify the target trial protocol (ie, the causal estimand, identifying assumptions, data analysis plan) and how it was mapped to the observational data, and (4) report the estimate obtained for each causal estimand, its precision, and findings from additional analyses to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to assumptions, and design and analysis choices. Application of the TARGET guideline recommendations aims to improve reporting transparency and peer review and help researchers, clinicians, and other readers interpret and apply the results."

      "abstract_md": "US children's health insurance is fragmented across public and private sources, with wide state variation. However, the extent of children's interactions with Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and their experience of uninsurance over 18 years of childhood remains unclear. Such estimates can provide a baseline for gauging the potential impact of upcoming Medicaid policy changes. To estimate insurance dynamics in relation to Medicaid or CHIP and uninsurance over childhood under post-Affordable Care Act (ACA) prepandemic policy conditions. Using a microsimulation model, we projected individual-level monthly insurance coverage (Medicaid or CHIP, Marketplace, employment-based, other, or uninsured) from birth until the 18th birthday for a simulated nationally representative cohort of 100&#x202f;000 US children. National data were synthesized (2015-2019), including natality records, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey pooled 2-year panels, and 1 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 3-year panel. Monthly insurance status was simulated by matching dynamically updated predictors to SIPP samples every 12 months. Predictors included annual family income as a percentage of the federal poverty level, insurance history, state, and age. The analysis was bootstrapped 1000 times to generate 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI). Insurance status and state of residence at birth. Cumulative insurance experience, overall and by subgroup. It was estimated that, by their 18th birthday, 61% (95% UI, 58%-63%) of US children were ever enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and 42% (95% UI, 38%-46%) were ever uninsured. An estimated 26% (95% UI, 24%-29%) of children were continuously enrolled in employment-based or other insurance excluding Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace. Among children born with Medicaid or CHIP, the share ever uninsured was 59% (95% UI, 48%-66%) in ACA nonexpansion states vs 36% (95% UI, 30%-41%) in expansion states. Across alternative categorizations of policy restrictiveness, the highest share of ever uninsured among children born with Medicaid or CHIP was consistently estimated in states with the most restrictive Medicaid and CHIP eligibility criteria. An estimated 3 of 4 US children relied on publicly subsidized insurance (Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace) or experienced a period without any insurance by their 18th birthday in the post-ACA, prepandemic policy environment. Substantial state heterogeneity in childhood uninsurance underscores the critical role of Medicaid policies."
