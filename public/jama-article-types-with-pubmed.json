      "abstract_md": "Since the start of the 21st century, more than 800&#x202f;000 firearm deaths and more than 2 million firearm injuries have occurred in the US. All categories of firearm violence-homicide, suicide, unintentional-result in reverberating harms to individuals, families, communities, and society. The collective responsibility of society is to safeguard the health and safety of its members, including from firearm harms. The JAMA Summit on Firearm Violence convened 60 thought leaders from a wide array of disciplines to chart an innovations roadmap that will lead to substantial reductions in firearm harms by 2040. The vision for 2040 is a country where firearm violence is substantially reduced and where all people and communities report feeling safe from firearm harms. The vision centers on practical solutions with an understanding of the country's constitutional protections for firearm ownership. Achieving the 2040 vision will require expansion of proven evidence-based strategies and the development of new, innovative approaches rooted in equity, accountability, and collective responsibility. Discussions centered on projecting a safer world, community violence interventions, technologic innovations, federal and state-level oversight of firearms, ethical considerations, and primordial prevention of firearm violence. The Summit charted a roadmap of 5 essential actions in the next 5 years to achieve this vision: (1) focus on communities and change fundamental structures that lead to firearm harms, (2) harness technological strengths responsibly, (3) change the narrative around firearm harms, (4) take a whole-government and whole-society approach, and (5) spark a research revolution on preventing firearm harms. A safer world will require investing in the discovery, implementation, and scaling of solutions that reduce firearm harms and center on the people and communities most affected by firearm violence."

      "abstract_md": "Levodopa enhances dopaminergic signaling and may stimulate neuroplasticity, which could potentially enhance motor recovery after stroke. Levodopa is used in stroke rehabilitation despite mixed evidence for its effectiveness. To determine whether levodopa compared with placebo, administered in addition to standardized rehabilitation based on active task-oriented training, is associated with enhanced motor recovery in patients with acute stroke. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial at 13 stroke units and centers and 11 collaborating rehabilitation centers in Switzerland. Between June 14, 2019 (first patient, first visit), and August 27, 2024 (last patient, last visit), 610 patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with clinically meaningful hemiparesis (ie, a total score of &#x2265;3 points on the following National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale items: motor arm, motor leg, or limb ataxia) were randomized 1:1 to receive levodopa or placebo. Statistical analyses were conducted from November 2024 to August 2025. Patients received levodopa/carbidopa (100 mg/25 mg; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;307) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;303) 3 times daily for 39 days, alongside standardized rehabilitation therapy based on active task-oriented training. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean between-group difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) total score (range, 0-100 points; fewer points indicate worse motor function; 6-point difference considered patient-relevant) at 3 months. Among the 610 participants (median [IQR] age, 73 [64-82] years; 252 [41.3%] female; median baseline FMA total score, 34 [14-54]), 28 participants died by 3 months, leaving 582 (95.4%) participants eligible for the primary analysis. At 3 months, the median (IQR) FMA total score was 68 (42-85) points in the levodopa group and 64 (44-83) points in the placebo group. The mean difference in the FMA total score between the levodopa and placebo groups was -0.90 points (95% CI, -3.78 to 1.98; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.54). There were 126 serious adverse events in the levodopa group and 129 in the placebo group; the most common was infection (levodopa, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55; placebo, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;44). In this randomized clinical trial, among patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation for acute stroke, levodopa added to standardized rehabilitation did not significantly improve motor function at 3 months compared with placebo plus standardized rehabilitation. These results do not support the use of levodopa as an adjunct to rehabilitation therapy for enhancing motor recovery after acute stroke. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03735901."

      "abstract_md": "US children's health insurance is fragmented across public and private sources, with wide state variation. However, the extent of children's interactions with Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and their experience of uninsurance over 18 years of childhood remains unclear. Such estimates can provide a baseline for gauging the potential impact of upcoming Medicaid policy changes. To estimate insurance dynamics in relation to Medicaid or CHIP and uninsurance over childhood under post-Affordable Care Act (ACA) prepandemic policy conditions. Using a microsimulation model, we projected individual-level monthly insurance coverage (Medicaid or CHIP, Marketplace, employment-based, other, or uninsured) from birth until the 18th birthday for a simulated nationally representative cohort of 100&#x202f;000 US children. National data were synthesized (2015-2019), including natality records, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey pooled 2-year panels, and 1 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 3-year panel. Monthly insurance status was simulated by matching dynamically updated predictors to SIPP samples every 12 months. Predictors included annual family income as a percentage of the federal poverty level, insurance history, state, and age. The analysis was bootstrapped 1000 times to generate 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI). Insurance status and state of residence at birth. Cumulative insurance experience, overall and by subgroup. It was estimated that, by their 18th birthday, 61% (95% UI, 58%-63%) of US children were ever enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and 42% (95% UI, 38%-46%) were ever uninsured. An estimated 26% (95% UI, 24%-29%) of children were continuously enrolled in employment-based or other insurance excluding Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace. Among children born with Medicaid or CHIP, the share ever uninsured was 59% (95% UI, 48%-66%) in ACA nonexpansion states vs 36% (95% UI, 30%-41%) in expansion states. Across alternative categorizations of policy restrictiveness, the highest share of ever uninsured among children born with Medicaid or CHIP was consistently estimated in states with the most restrictive Medicaid and CHIP eligibility criteria. An estimated 3 of 4 US children relied on publicly subsidized insurance (Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace) or experienced a period without any insurance by their 18th birthday in the post-ACA, prepandemic policy environment. Substantial state heterogeneity in childhood uninsurance underscores the critical role of Medicaid policies."

      "abstract_md": "Hemorrhoidal disease, pathology of the tissue lining of the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the US. Hemorrhoidal disease may impair quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed (concurrent internal and external hemorrhoidal disease). Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible). External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (eg, flavonoids [thought to improve venous tone]) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions. Rubber band ligation-placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow-resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20%. Sclerotherapy, which induces fibrosis with a sclerosant injection, is efficacious in the short term (weeks to months) among 70% to 85% of patients, but long-term remission occurs in only one-third of patients. Infrared coagulation uses heat to coagulate hemorrhoidal tissue, yielding 70% to 80% success in reducing bleeding and prolapse. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, for disease unresponsive to office-based therapy or for mixed hemorrhoidal disease, achieves low recurrence (2%-10%), although with longer recovery (9-14 days). External hemorrhoidal disease rarely requires surgery unless acutely thrombosed. Outpatient clot evacuation within 72 hours of onset of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is associated with decreased pain and reduced risk of repeat thrombosis. Patients presenting more than 72 hours after external hemorrhoid acute thrombosis should receive medical treatment (eg, stool softeners, oral and topical analgesics such as 5% lidocaine). Hemorrhoidal disease affects 10 million people in the US. First-line treatment is increased fiber intake, avoidance of straining during defecation, and phlebotonics. In-office rubber band ligation for grade I to III internal hemorrhoid disease is first-line procedural treatment for persistent symptoms despite conservative therapies. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for grade III to IV prolapse, thrombosis, or mixed hemorrhoidal disease that does not improve with less invasive approaches."

However, their effects in those with stage 4 CKD or little to no albuminuria remain uncertain. To assess whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or degree of albuminuria, measured by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), modifies the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes. SGLT2 inhibitor trials participating in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium (SMART-C). Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials within SMART-C evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor with label indications for reducing CKD progression including at least 500 participants in each group with at least 6 months of follow-up. Treatment effects in individual trials were pooled using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. CKD progression, defined as kidney failure, at least 50% reduction in eGFR, or death due to kidney failure. Other outcomes included annual rate of eGFR decline and kidney failure. Among 70&#x202f;361 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.8 [8.7] years; 24&#x202f;595 [35.0%] females) in 10 randomized trials, 2314 (3.3%) experienced CKD progression and 988 (1.4%) reached kidney failure. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of CKD progression (25.4 vs 40.3 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.57-0.68]), irrespective of baseline eGFR (HR of 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.71] for eGFR &#x2265;60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47-0.70] for eGFR of 45 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 0.64 [95% CI, 0.54-0.75] for eGFR of 30 to &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2; and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60-0.83] for eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2; P for trend&#x2009;=&#x2009;.16) and baseline albuminuria (HR of 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44-0.76] for albuminuria &#x2264;30 mg/g; 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57-0.96] for &gt;30-300 mg/g; and 0.57 [95% CI, 0.52-0.64] for more than 300 mg/g; P for trend&#x2009;=&#x2009;.49). Although the magnitude of protection varied, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the annual rate of eGFR decline across all eGFR and UACR subgroups, including when participants with and without diabetes were analyzed separately. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of kidney failure alone (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58-0.75]). In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were found to lower the risk of CKD progression regardless of baseline eGFR or albuminuria, including in patients with stage 4 CKD or minimal albuminuria, supporting their routine use to improve kidney outcomes across the full spectrum of kidney function among patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure."

To assess the relative and absolute effects of SGLT2 inhibitor use across efficacy and serious safety outcomes in participants stratified by diabetes status and UACR (&#x2265;200 mg/g or &lt;200 mg/g). Included 8 randomized clinical trials that studied an SGLT2 inhibitor with a label indication for use in kidney disease and recorded longitudinal kidney outcomes and baseline data on albuminuria. Data were combined using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis; group-specific absolute effects were estimated by applying relevant relative risks to the event rates of the placebo groups. Assessed the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor use on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. Heterogeneity by baseline level of UACR was assessed separately by diabetes status. A total of 58&#x202f;816 participants (mean age, 64 [SD, 10] years; 35% were female; 48&#x202f;946 with diabetes and 9870 without diabetes) were included from trials comparing an SGLT2 inhibitor vs placebo. Allocation to an SGLT2 inhibitor produced a lower rate of kidney disease progression (33 vs 48 for placebo per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.60-0.70] in those with diabetes and 32 vs 46 per 1000; HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.85] in those without diabetes), a lower rate of acute kidney injury (14 vs 18 per 1000 [HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.87] with diabetes and 13 vs 18 per 1000 [HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92] without diabetes), a lower rate of any hospitalization (202 vs 231 per 1000 [HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.92] with diabetes and 203 vs 237 per 1000 [HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95] without diabetes), and a lower rate of any death (42 vs 47 per 1000 [HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91] with diabetes and 42 vs 48 per 1000 [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78-1.05] without diabetes). Diabetes-specific HRs were similar in participants (with a UACR &#x2265;200 mg/g vs with a UACR &lt;200 mg/g) considered separately. Higher absolute risk at a UACR of 200 mg/g or greater meant larger estimated absolute benefits on kidney disease progression were evident in this subgroup. Clear absolute benefits were evident for other efficacy outcomes, and particularly hospitalization, in participants with a UACR less than 200 mg/g. Net absolute benefits remained in the analyses of non-heart failure populations and when estimated glomerular filtration rate was less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Within the studied participants, there were clear absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney, hospitalization, and mortality outcomes irrespective of diabetes status and level of UACR."

      "abstract_md": "For patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury, persistent need for dialysis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high health care use, and poor quality of life. To test the effect of a conservative dialysis strategy on recovery of kidney function. This multicenter, unblinded, randomized superiority trial enrolled participants with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury who had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, had already initiated kidney replacement therapy, and were hemodynamically stable, with planned intermittent hemodialysis between January 23, 2020, and March 10, 2025, at 4 clinical sites in the United States. Of 909 patients assessed for eligibility, 221 were randomized and 220 received the allocated intervention. The date of last follow-up was June 10, 2025. With the conservative dialysis strategy, participants received dialysis only when specific metabolic or clinical indications were met. Participants in the conventional dialysis group received dialysis 3 times per week until urine output or creatinine clearance criteria were met. The primary study end point was unadjusted kidney function recovery at hospital discharge, defined as being alive and not receiving dialysis, with at least 14 consecutive days without dialysis (including after discharge). Two prespecified key secondary end points were the number of dialysis sessions per week and the number of dialysis-free days to day 28. The mean age of participants was 56 years (SD, 16 years). A total of 148 of 220 participants (67%) were male, 28 (13%) were Black, and 133 (60%) were White. Mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 64.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD, 30.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). Participants had started kidney replacement therapy a median of 9 days (IQR, 5-18.5 days) before randomization. In the conservative dialysis intervention group, 70 of 109 participants (64%) achieved kidney function recovery at hospital discharge vs 55 of 109 participants (50%) in the conventional dialysis control group (difference, 13.8% [95% CI, 0.8%-26.8%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.02-3.03; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04]; after prespecified adjustment: odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.86-2.84; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.15]). Participants in the conservative dialysis group received fewer dialysis sessions per week (median, 1.8 [IQR, 0-2.6] vs 3.1 [IQR, 2.6-3.5]; difference, -1.4 [95% CI, -1.8 to -1.0]) and recovered earlier (21 [IQR, 0-28] vs 5 [IQR, 0-21] consecutive dialysis-free days to day 28; difference, 16 days [95% CI, 5-27]). Dialysis-associated hypotension occurred less frequently in the conservative dialysis group (69 vs 97 events). A conservative dialysis strategy in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury resulted in a shorter time to and higher rates of recovery of kidney function in the unadjusted analysis. Given uncertainty regarding the estimated effect size, this approach should be tested in a larger study population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04218370."

Few effective therapies improve walking performance in people with PAD. Metformin is a widely available and inexpensive therapy for type 2 diabetes with pleiotropic effects that include activating AMP-activated protein kinase, reducing oxidative stress, and stimulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). To determine whether metformin improves 6-minute walk distance, compared with placebo, in people with PAD and without diabetes at 6-month follow-up. Randomized double-blind clinical trial involving 4 centers in the US. Enrollment began May 23, 2017, and ended on February 17, 2025, with 202 of the targeted 212 (95%) enrolled, due to funding limitations. Participants were adults aged 50 years and older with PAD. Final follow-up occurred August 19, 2025. Participants with PAD were randomized to receive either metformin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;97) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;105) for 6 months. The primary outcome was 6-month change in 6-minute walk distance (minimum clinically important difference, 8 to 20 m). Secondary outcomes were maximal treadmill walking time, pain-free treadmill walking time, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance and speed scores, the Short-Form 36 physical functioning score, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Results were adjusted for site and the baseline value for each outcome measure. Of 202 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 69.6 [8.4] years, 56 [28%] female, 79 [39%] Black), 179 (89%) completed 6-month follow-up. Metformin did not significantly improve 6-minute walk distance compared with placebo (metformin: 358.6 to 353.2 m, within-group change: -5.4 m; placebo: 359.8 to 354.5 m, within-group change: -5.3 m, adjusted between-group difference: 1.1 m [95% CI, -16.3 to 18.6 m]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.90). Compared with placebo, metformin did not significantly improve any secondary outcomes. The most common serious adverse events were cardiovascular events (3.1% for metformin and 1.9% for placebo). The most common nonserious adverse events were indigestion/stomach upset (64.9% for metformin and 40.6% for placebo) and headache (37.2% for metformin and 49.5% for placebo). Among people with PAD without diabetes, metformin did not improve 6-minute walk distance at 6-month follow-up compared with placebo. These results do not support metformin for improving walking performance in patients with PAD. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03054519."

To evaluate the risk of death or major ischemic events within 90 days after a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy in patients at high risk of cardiac events who had undergone major vascular or general surgery operations and developed postoperative anemia. This parallel, single-blind, randomized clinical superiority trial included 1428 veterans (&#x2265;18 y) at high cardiac risk undergoing major vascular or general surgery operations. Participants were enrolled from February 2018 to March 2023 across 16 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the US. Seven hundred fourteen participants with postoperative hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL were randomized to a liberal strategy (transfusion trigger at hemoglobin level &lt;10 g/dL) and 714 to a restrictive strategy (transfusion trigger at hemoglobin &lt;7 g/dL). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, acute kidney failure, or ischemic stroke within 90 days after randomization. Secondary end points included a composite of cardiac complications other than myocardial infarction (arrhythmias, heart failure, and nonfatal cardiac arrest). Of the 1424 analyzed veterans (mean age, 69.9 [SD, 7.9] years; 1393 male [97.8%]; 268 Black [18.8%]; 48 Hispanic [4.1%]; 1071 White [75.2%]), 1297 (91.1%) underwent vascular surgical procedures.

To determine whether prediction of first coronary events is improved by adding information on coronary atherosclerosis from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to a model using the pooled cohort equation (PCE) risk score tool and the coronary artery calcification score (CACS). Observational cohort study including individuals aged 50 to 64 years randomly recruited from the general population and examined at 6 university hospitals in Sweden from 2013 to 2018, with a median follow-up of 7.8 years. A sample of 30&#x202f;154 individuals underwent cardiopulmonary imaging, physical examinations, routine laboratory tests, questionnaires, and/or functional tests. This study included 24&#x202f;791 individuals without previous cardiovascular disease for whom high-quality CCTA images were available. Events were followed up via registers until September 2024. The information used from the CCTA images was the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (segment involvement score), presence of noncalcified atherosclerosis, and presence of coronary obstructive disease (stenosis &#x2265;50%). The outcome was a composite of first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. During follow-up, 304 coronary events occurred. Segment involvement scores of 3 to 4 and greater than 4 and presence of noncalcified atherosclerosis were associated with hazard ratios of 2.71 (95% CI, 1.34-5.44), 5.27 (95% CI, 2.50-11.07), and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.23-2.22), respectively. In a model based on the PCE and CACS, CCTA-derived data improved risk discrimination (C statistic improved from 0.764 to 0.779; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004) and risk reclassification (net reclassification improvement of 0.133 [95% CI, 0.031-0.165]), conferred a net correct upward reclassification of 14.2% in those with events and incorrectly classified 1.6% of participants not experiencing an event into a higher-risk category. Because of the low event rate in the cohort, reclassification mainly occurred in the group classified as at low risk (&lt;5%) according to the PCE. Information on coronary atherosclerosis from CCTA modestly improved risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors and CACS in identifying individuals at risk of coronary events and in need of primary prevention."

Many patients with HeFH do not achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals with the currently available lipid-lowering therapies. To evaluate the efficacy of enlicitide decanoate (an oral proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor) vs placebo in adults with HeFH requiring further lowering of LDL-C levels despite use of statin therapy. This phase 3, randomized clinical trial included persons aged 18 years or older with HeFH currently using lipid-lowering therapy (taking at least a moderate- or high-intensity statin) and either an LDL-C level of 55 mg/dL or greater and a history of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or greater without a history of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The trial was conducted at 59 sites across 17 countries; the first participant was screened on August 8, 2023, and the last follow-up visit occurred on April 7, 2025. Participants were randomized (2:1) to 20 mg of enlicitide (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;202) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;101) once daily for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 24. The secondary outcomes included the mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 52, the mean percentage change at week 24 in levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B, and the median percentage change at week 24 in lipoprotein(a). Of the 303 participants (mean age, 52.4 [SD, 13.5] years; 51% were female) randomized, 293 (96.7%) completed the trial. The mean LDL-C level was 119.0 mg/dL (SD, 41.0 mg/dL) at baseline, all had statin current use (81.5% were taking a high-intensity statin), and 64.4% were taking ezetimibe. The mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 24 was -58.2% in the enlicitide group vs 2.6% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -59.4% [95% CI, -65.6% to -53.2%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001).

At week 24, the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C level was -52.3% in the enlicitide group vs 2.1% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -53.0% [95% CI, -58.5% to -47.4%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), the mean percentage change in apolipoprotein B level was -48.2% vs 1.8%, respectively (between-group difference, -49.1% [95% CI, -54.0% to -44.3%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), and the median percentage change in lipoprotein(a) level was -24.7% vs -1.6% (between-group difference, -27.5% [95% CI, -34.3% to -20.6%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and study discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between groups. Among adults with HeFH, treatment with enlicitide was well tolerated and significantly reduced levels of LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C, and lipoprotein(a).

      "abstract_md": "The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan lowered blood pressure (BP) among Black adults in a controlled environment, but to date, there are no grocery shopping strategies that replicated its health effects in a community setting. The Groceries for Black Residents of Boston to Stop Hypertension (GoFresh) trial was conducted to determine the effects of low sodium-DASH groceries on systolic BP. This parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in Boston from August 2022 to September 2025 among Black residents of urban communities with few grocery stores, a systolic BP of 120 to less than 150 mm Hg, a diastolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, and no hypertension treatment. Data were analyzed from June through October 2025. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of home-delivered, DASH-patterned groceries ordered weekly with dietitian counseling without emphasizing cost or three $500 stipends every 4 weeks intended for self-directed grocery shopping. The primary comparison was the difference in the 3-month change in model-estimated office systolic BP (based on 3 measurements over at least 2 visits) between interventions. Adherence was assessed via 24-hour urine collection. Secondary outcomes included diastolic BP, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c levels, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Maintenance of effects was assessed 3 months after intervention cessation. Among 180 participants, (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [13.3] years; 102 female [56.7%]; 180 self-reported Black [100%]; 12 Hispanic [6.7%]), 175 individuals (97.2%) completed the primary outcome assessment. Mean (SD) baseline systolic BP and diastolic BP were 130.0 (6.7) mm Hg and 79.8 (8.1) mm Hg. At 3 months, the mean systolic BP changed -5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.4, to-3.9 mm Hg) in the DASH-patterned group and -2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.1 to -0.4 mm Hg) in the self-directed group (difference in changes, -3.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to -0.8 mm Hg; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009). Compared with the self-directed group, after 3 months the DASH-patterned group changed mean diastolic BP by -2.4 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 mm Hg), urine sodium level by -545 mg/24 h (95% CI, -1041 to -50 mg/24 h), and LDL cholesterol by -8.0 mg/dL (95% CI, -13.7 to -2.3 mg/dL) (to convert LDL cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). Effects were not maintained 6 months after the intervention was initiated. No effects occurred in BMI or hemoglobin A1c level. In this study, a program of home-delivered, DASH-style groceries plus dietitian counseling decreased BP and LDL cholesterol levels beyond comparable monetary compensation. However, effects were not maintained after the intervention ended. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05121337."

Coffee is the most commonly consumed caffeinated beverage in the US, and a randomized trial assessing caffeinated coffee consumption in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not previously been performed. To determine the effect of caffeinated coffee consumption compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeine on recurrent AF. This was a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 200 current or previous (within past 5 years) coffee-drinking adults with persistent AF, or atrial flutter with a history of AF, planned for electrical cardioversion from 5 hospitals in the US, Canada, and Australia between November 2021 and December 2024. The date of final follow-up was June 5, 2025. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to regular caffeinated coffee consumption vs coffee and caffeine abstinence for 6 months. Patients in the coffee consumption group were encouraged to drink at least 1 cup of caffeinated coffee daily. Patients in the abstinence group were encouraged to completely abstain from both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and other caffeine-containing products. The primary end point was clinically detected recurrence of AF or atrial flutter over 6 months. Two hundred patients (mean [SD] age, 69 [11] years; 71% male) were randomized to caffeinated coffee consumption (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) or coffee abstinence (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100). Baseline coffee intake was 7 cups (IQR, 7-18) per week in both groups. During follow-up, coffee intake in the consumption and abstinence groups was 7 (IQR, 6-11) and 0 (IQR, 0-2) cups per week, respectively, resulting in a between-group difference of 7 cups (95% CI, 7-7) per week. In the primary analysis, AF or atrial flutter recurrence was less in the coffee consumption (47%) than the coffee abstinence (64%) group, resulting in a 39% lower hazard of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.42-0.89]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). A comparable benefit of coffee consumption was observed with AF recurrence only. There was no significant difference in adverse events. In this clinical trial of coffee drinkers after successful cardioversion, allocation to consumption of caffeinated coffee averaging 1 cup a day was associated with less recurrence of AF or atrial flutter compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeinated products.

      "abstract_md": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic condition, results in lifelong increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increases lifetime cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Most individuals with FH remain undiagnosed, so early FH identification and treatment could lower CVD burden. To evaluate the projected cost-effectiveness of population sequential FH screening (lipid testing followed by genetic testing after a high LDL-C measurement) at 10 or 18 years of age. The CVD Policy Model, a validated discrete event simulation of CVD risk factor management and CVD outcomes in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants, was used to simulate lifetime health and economic outcomes from a health care sector perspective for a hypothetical cohort of 4.2 million US 10-year-olds. Individual characteristics and health care processes informed CVD events (coronary heart disease or stroke) and survival probabilities. Model inputs included national data sources, clinical trials, pooled longitudinal cohort studies, and published literature. Usual care assumed only opportunistic lipid testing and LDL-C and CVD risk-guided treatment. When added to usual care, sequential FH screening strategies examined combinations of childhood (age 10 years) or early adulthood (age 18 years) screening with 3 LDL-C thresholds (&#x2265;130 mg/dL, &#x2265;160 mg/dL, or &#x2265;190 mg/dL) to select patients for genetic testing. Primary outcomes were direct health care costs (2021 US dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually. Strategies with an ICER of less than $100&#x202f;000 per QALY gained were considered cost-effective. For the simulated cohort, usual care would lead to 3&#x202f;118&#x202f;000 (95% uncertainty interval, 3&#x202f;061&#x202f;000-3&#x202f;192&#x202f;000) total lifetime CVD events, with 16&#x202f;182 (95% uncertainty interval, 15&#x202f;683-16&#x202f;827) among those with FH. Childhood FH screening could avert between 1385 and 1820 CVD events (&lt;0.1% reduction in overall population), and early adulthood FH screening could avert between 1154 and 1448 CVD events (&lt;0.1% reduction). While effective, no FH screening strategies were cost-effective relative to usual care; screening at age 18 years using an LDL-C threshold of 190 mg/dL or greater had the lowest ICER, at $289&#x202f;700 per QALY gained. Sequential FH screening could become cost-effective vs usual care if lifetime lipid monitoring plus lifestyle therapy increased after a high screening LDL-C result, including for patients with non-FH dyslipidemias. Sequential FH screening in childhood or early adulthood could be effective but not cost-effective vs usual care. However, sequential FH screening could become cost-effective under highly optimistic assumptions about increased lifestyle therapy and increased lifetime lipid monitoring for patients with non-FH dyslipidemias."

The presence of MASLD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. The most common chronic liver disease worldwide, MASLD affects approximately 30% to 40% of the general adult population globally (with varying prevalence across continents), including approximately 60% to 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes and approximately 70% to 80% of those with obesity. It is typically diagnosed based on an ultrasonographic finding of hepatic steatosis, along with at least 1 of 5 features of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal overweight or obesity, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, hypertension, elevated level of plasma triglycerides, and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) for women who consume less than 140 g/wk of alcohol (&lt;2 standard drinks/d) and for men who consume less than 210 g/wk (&lt;3 standard drinks/d) and have no other known causes of steatosis such as use of a particular medication (eg, corticosteroids, tamoxifen, or methotrexate), hepatitis C, or iron overload. Other risk factors for MASLD include older age (&#x2265;50 years) and male sex (male:female ratio approximately 2). The Fibrosis-4 index (a scoring system incorporating age, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (a noninvasive imaging technique) are commonly used to stage hepatic fibrosis in patients with MASLD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by certain extrahepatic cancers (primarily gastrointestinal, breast, and gynecologic cancer) and liver-related complications, including cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding), and hepatocellular carcinoma. First-line treatment of MASLD involves behavioral modifications (including hypocaloric low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol) and management of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Bariatric surgery should be considered for patients with MASLD and a body mass index greater than 35. Resmetirom (a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor &#x3b2;-selective agonist) and subcutaneous semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) are conditionally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with MASH who have moderate to advanced fibrosis. A highly prevalent condition among adults worldwide, MASLD is associated with liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. First-line treatment includes behavioral modifications, including a weight-reducing diet, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol. Resmetirom and semaglutide are conditionally FDA-approved medications for the treatment of adults with MASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis."

This serial cross-sectional analysis estimated emissions from all inhalers approved for asthma or COPD using aggregated dispensing data across the US outpatient pharmaceutical market linked to estimated greenhouse gas emissions by inhaler. All products were characterized based on their active pharmaceutical ingredients, device type, propellant type, therapeutic class, branded status, manufacturer, payer, and pharmacy benefit manager. Key end points included product utilization, greenhouse gas emissions (measured in carbon dioxide equivalents [CO2e] based on previously validated studies), and the social costs of emissions, which account for the net harms to society from greenhouse gases. A total of 1.6 billion inhalers were dispensed in the US from 2014 to 2024, generating an estimated 24.9 million metric tons of CO2e (mtCO2e). Annual emissions increased by 24% from 1.9 million mtCO2e in 2014 to 2.3 million mtCO2e in 2024. Metered-dose inhalers were responsible for 98% of all emissions during the study period, and emissions were heavily concentrated among short-acting &#x3b2;-agonist, inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting &#x3b2;-agonist, and inhaled corticosteroid classes. Albuterol, budesonide-formoterol, and fluticasone propionate inhalers accounted for 87% of total emissions. The estimated social costs of emissions were $5.7 billion (lower bound, $3.5 billion; upper bound, $10.0 billion). Inhaler-related emissions in the US have increased over the past decade. Policymakers and regulators seeking to reduce emissions should identify targeted solutions aimed at shifting utilization to currently marketed dry powder and soft mist inhalers while facilitating the entry of newer, affordable metered-dose products containing propellants with low global warming potential."

To compare FFR-guided complete revascularization of nonculprit lesions vs culprit-only revascularization in patients with NSTEMI and multivessel disease. This prospective, investigator-initiated, multicenter, international randomized clinical trial was conducted at 9 hospitals in Europe. Patients with NSTEMI and multivessel disease who had successful revascularization of the culprit lesion were enrolled between June 2018 and July 2024, and final follow-up was completed on July 21, 2025. The analysis was conducted on July 28, 2025. Eligibility criteria included the presence of at least 1 stenosis of at least 50% in a nonculprit lesion amendable for revascularization. Patients were randomized to receive either FFR-guided complete or culprit-only revascularization during the index procedure. Staged revascularization within 6 weeks after the index procedure was allowed in the culprit-only group. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, any revascularization, and stroke at 1 year. Key secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome, net adverse clinical events, all-cause death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac rehospitalization, and bleeding events. Among 478 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 65.9 [10.6] years; 347 [72.9%] males), 240 were randomized to receive FFR-guided complete revascularization and 238 were randomized to receive culprit-only revascularization, with crossover occurring in 7 patients in the culprit-only group. The primary outcome occurred in 13 patients (5.5%) in the FFR-guided complete revascularization group vs 32 patients (13.6%) in the culprit-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.20-0.72]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003). Rates of any revascularization (3.0% vs 11.5%; HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11-0.56]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and net adverse clinical events (6.3% vs 15.3%; HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.21-0.70]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002) were also significantly lower in the complete revascularization group, while there were no significant differences in the remaining secondary outcomes. FFR-guided complete revascularization during the index procedure resulted in a significant reduction in the composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, any revascularization, and stroke at 1 year. This was mainly driven by reduced repeat revascularization. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03562572."

      "abstract_md": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing health and health care on an unprecedented scale. Though the potential benefits are massive, so are the risks. The JAMA Summit on AI discussed how health and health care AI should be developed, evaluated, regulated, disseminated, and monitored. Health and health care AI is wide-ranging, including clinical tools (eg, sepsis alerts or diabetic retinopathy screening software), technologies used by individuals with health concerns (eg, mobile health apps), tools used by health care systems to improve business operations (eg, revenue cycle management or scheduling), and hybrid tools supporting both business operations (eg, documentation and billing) and clinical activities (eg, suggesting diagnoses or treatment plans). Many AI tools are already widely adopted, especially for medical imaging, mobile health, health care business operations, and hybrid functions like scribing outpatient visits. All these tools can have important health effects (good or bad), but these effects are often not quantified because evaluations are extremely challenging or not required, in part because many are outside the US Food and Drug Administration's regulatory oversight. A major challenge in evaluation is that a tool's effects are highly dependent on the human-computer interface, user training, and setting in which the tool is used. Numerous efforts lay out standards for the responsible use of AI, but most focus on monitoring for safety (eg, detection of model hallucinations) or institutional compliance with various process measures, and do not address effectiveness (ie, demonstration of improved outcomes). Ensuring AI is deployed equitably and in a manner that improves health outcomes or, if improving efficiency of health care delivery, does so safely, requires progress in 4 areas. First, multistakeholder engagement throughout the total product life cycle is needed. This effort would include greater partnership of end users with developers in initial tool creation and greater partnership of developers, regulators, and health care systems in the evaluation of tools as they are deployed. Second, measurement tools for evaluation and monitoring should be developed and disseminated. Beyond proposed monitoring and certification initiatives, this will require new methods and expertise to allow health care systems to conduct or participate in rapid, efficient, and robust evaluations of effectiveness. The third priority is creation of a nationally representative data infrastructure and learning environment to support the generation of generalizable knowledge about health effects of AI tools across different settings. Fourth, an incentive structure should be promoted, using market forces and policy levers, to drive these changes. AI will disrupt every part of health and health care delivery in the coming years. Given the many long-standing problems in health care, this disruption represents an incredible opportunity. However, the odds that this disruption will improve health for all will depend heavily on the creation of an ecosystem capable of rapid, efficient, robust, and generalizable knowledge about the consequences of these tools on health."

      "abstract_md": "Peripheral neuropathy, defined as damage to peripheral nerves, affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide. More than 200 causes of peripheral neuropathy exist, with symptoms ranging in severity from mild toe numbness to debilitating symptoms that can require a wheelchair. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, affecting approximately 206 million people worldwide. Peripheral neuropathy is typically length-dependent, which means that symptoms appear in the longest nerve axons (toes) and progress proximally over time. Peripheral neuropathy is typically symmetric and affects sensory axons more than motor axons. Diabetic neuropathy, which is often associated with both sensory symptoms, such as pain, tingling, or numbness; mild weakness; and autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, accounts for more than 50% of peripheral neuropathy in Western populations. Other causes of neuropathy include hereditary causes, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, toxic neuropathy from medications (chemotherapies [eg, cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine], amiodarone, or HIV nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [eg, stavudine, zalcitabine]); alcohol; vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12; and monoclonal gammopathies. Up to 27% of adults with neuropathy have no identifiable etiology for their neuropathy after diagnostic testing. Recommended initial testing includes blood glucose (for diabetes), serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (for monoclonal gammopathies). First-line medications for neuropathic pain are the &#x3b1;2-&#x3b4; calcium channel subunit ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine and venlafaxine; and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitryptyline and nortriptyline. Pain often persists despite medical management. At least a 50% reduction in pain was observed in 38% of those with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy receiving 1200 mg of gabapentin daily. Combination drug therapies for neuropathic pain may provide added benefit. The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy depends on its underlying cause, but complete reversal of nerve damage is uncommon even in cases for which there are available treatments. Peripheral neuropathy affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide and may cause sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in Western countries. First-line therapies for neuropathic pain include gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and amitriptyline."

      "abstract_md": "People who are critically buried by an avalanche typically die of asphyxia within 35 minutes, often making timely rescue impossible. The development of new strategies to delay asphyxiation is crucial to improve survival rates. To investigate the efficacy of a novel, user-carried avalanche safety device that delivers airflow from avalanche debris to the user's airway without requiring supplemental oxygen or a mouthpiece. This randomized, blinded, clinical trial was organized by 4 institutions and conducted at 1 field location in Italy from January to March 2023. Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years were enrolled. Trial participants underwent a critical snow burial simulation while in a prone position covered by at least 50 cm of snow. Vital parameters were continuously monitored throughout the simulation to ensure participant safety and to collect physiological data. Participants were randomized to the safety device group (using the Safeback SBX device) or the control group (using a sham device). The safety device group completed an unblinded control in which the participants who remained buried after 35 minutes were seamlessly transferred to the sham device. The primary outcome measure was the time to oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) less than 80% (event) during 35 minutes of monitoring, comparing intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes included oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations at different distances in the snow. Of 36 randomized participants, 24 performed and completed the trial and were included in the final analysis. The median (IQR) age was 27 (25-32) years, and 13 (54%) were male. In the safety device group, the median (IQR) burial duration was 35.0 (35.0-35.0) minutes and there were no events; in the control group, the median (IQR) burial duration was 6.4 (4.8-13.5) minutes and there were 7 events. The safety device group had a significantly lower risk of termination due to Spo2 less than 80% (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001 for both log-rank and Breslow tests). Carbon dioxide in the air pocket was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%) vs 6.1% (95% CI, 5.1%-7.1%) and oxygen was 19.8% (95% CI, 19.5%-20.1%) vs 12.4% (95% CI, 11.2%-13.5%) at the same points in the safety device and control groups, respectively. A user-carried avalanche safety device that delivers airflow from avalanche debris to the user's airways without requiring supplemental oxygen delayed critical hypoxemia and hypercapnia during simulated critical burial.

      "abstract_md": "Hypothyroidism is a disease of thyroid hormone deficiency. The prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 12% worldwide, depending on iodine intake, and it is more common in women and older adults. Untreated hypothyroidism can cause serious health complications such as heart failure and myxedema coma. Hashimoto thyroiditis (an autoimmune disease) is the cause of primary hypothyroidism in up to 85% of patients with hypothyroidism living in areas with adequate nutritional iodine levels. The risk of developing hypothyroidism is associated with genetic factors (having a first-degree relative with hypothyroidism), environmental factors (iodine deficiency), undergoing neck surgery or receiving radiation therapy, pregnancy in the setting of underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, and with the use of certain medications (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and amiodarone). Patients with hypothyroidism may have nonspecific symptoms due to metabolic slowing, including fatigue (68%-83%), weight gain (24%-59%), cognitive issues (45%-48%) such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating, and menstrual irregularities (approximately 23%) such as oligomenorrhea and menorrhagia. Hypothyroidism can cause insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, increase the risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, and negatively affect female reproductive health, causing disrupted ovulation, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Untreated hypothyroidism may progress to severe hypothyroidism with decompensation (myxedema coma), which is a condition associated with hypothermia, hypotension, and altered mental status that requires treatment in an intensive care unit and has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed based on biochemical testing; a high thyrotropin (TSH) level and a low free thyroxine (T4) level indicate overt primary hypothyroidism. Screening for hypothyroidism is not recommended for asymptomatic individuals. Targeted testing is recommended for patients who are considered high risk (eg, patients with type 1 diabetes). First-line treatment for hypothyroidism is synthetic levothyroxine to normalize thyrotropin levels. Initial dosages should be tailored to patient-specific factors. Lower starting doses should be used for older patients or those with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. Thyrotropin monitoring should be performed 6 to 8 weeks after initiating levothyroxine treatment, or when changing the dose, and then annually once the thyrotropin level is at goal to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment, both of which are associated with cardiovascular health risks. Hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue, weight gain, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, cardiovascular disease such as heart failure, menstrual irregularities, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Levothyroxine is the first-line treatment to normalize the thyrotropin level and improve clinical manifestations due to hypothyroidism."

      "abstract_md": "The permanent metallic occluders used for atrial septal defect (ASD) closure are associated with risks of late complications and may impede access to the left atrium. Bioresorbable occluders have the potential to address these limitations but have yet to be validated in randomized clinical trials. To evaluate whether a bioresorbable occluder is noninferior to a metallic occluder based on its efficacy and safety for transcatheter ASD closure. This multicenter, noninferiority, open-label randomized clinical trial included participants with secundum ASD. Enrollment occurred from May 8, 2021, to August 3, 2022, at 10 hospital sites in China. The 2-year follow-up period ended in September 2024. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a bioresorbable occluder (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;116) or a metallic occluder (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;114). The primary outcome was the success rate of ASD closure at 6 months (closure success was defined as procedural success with a residual shunt diameter of &#x2264;2 mm, which was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography). At the 2-year follow-up, the occluder groups were compared regarding the success of ASD closure and the device-related adverse events. The degradation profile of the bioresorbable occluder was assessed at 2 years. Of the 230 participants randomized, implantation was not attempted in 1 participant in the bioresorbable occluder group due to a small femoral vein, leaving 229 (median age, 14.1 years [IQR, 7.0 to 37.3 years]; 68% were female). At 6 months, the success rate of ASD closure was 96.5% (111 of 115 patients) for the bioresorbable occluder group vs 97.4% (111 of 114 patients) for the metallic occluder group (between-group difference, -0.8 percentage points [95% CI, -5.0 to 3.7]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001 for noninferiority). At 2 years, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in ASD closure success (94.8% [109/115] in the bioresorbable occluder group vs 96.5% [110/114] in the metallic occluder group; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.75), or in device-related adverse events (2.6% [3/115] vs 3.5% [4/114], respectively; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.72). The rate of degradation at 2 years was approximately 99.8% for the bioresorbable occluder. A bioresorbable occluder is noninferior to a metallic occluder for ASD closure, with near-complete degradation by 2 years. These findings suggest that a bioresorbable occluder could be a valuable addition to the options for transcatheter ASD closure. chictr.org.cn Identifier: ChiCTR2100044408."

Discontinuation of GLP-1RAs proximal to pregnancy could affect gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcomes. To compare gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcomes with and without exposure to GLP-1RAs before or during early pregnancy. Retrospective cohort study of 149&#x202f;790 singleton pregnancies delivered between June 1, 2016, and March 31, 2025, within a single academic health system. A GLP-1RA order between 3 years before and 90 days after conception, with propensity score matching of each exposed pregnancy to 3 unexposed pregnancies. The primary outcome was gestational weight gain. Secondary outcomes were excess gestational weight gain, large and small for gestational age birth weight, birth weight percentile for gestational age and sex, birth length, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Among 149&#x202f;790 pregnancies during the study period, 1792 (448 exposed and 1344 unexposed) were matched for the primary analysis. Exposed pregnancies had mean maternal age of 34.0 years (SD, 4.7 years) and prepregnancy body mass index of 36.1 (SD, 6.5; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); 378 of 448 (84%) had obesity and 104 of 448 (23%) had preexisting diabetes; 136 (30%) were Hispanic, 49 (11%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 223 (50%) were non-Hispanic White; and 43 (10%) had public insurance. The GLP-1RA-exposed pregnancies had greater gestational weight gain (mean, 13.7 kg [SD, 9.2]) than propensity score-matched unexposed pregnancies (mean, 10.5 kg [SD, 8.0]), a difference of 3.3 kg (95% CI, 2.3-4.2; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The GLP-1RA-exposed group had a higher risk of excess gestational weight gain (65% vs 49%; risk ratio [RR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.47), greater mean birth weight percentile (58.4% vs 54.8%; difference, 3.6%; 95% CI, 0.2%-6.9%), and higher risk of preterm delivery (17% vs 13%; RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.69), gestational diabetes (20% vs 15%; RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.68), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (46% vs 36%; RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49). There was no difference in birth length, risk of large or small for gestational age birth weight, or cesarean delivery. In a cohort composed primarily of women with obesity, GLP-1RA use with subsequent prepregnancy or early pregnancy discontinuation was associated with more gestational weight gain and a higher risk of preterm delivery, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."

To determine whether a direct-to-patient digital health program increases lung cancer screening. Randomized clinical trial enrolling individuals aged 50 to 77 years who met Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services criteria for lung cancer screening between April 18, 2022, and May 30, 2023, at 2 academic health systems in the southeastern US. The date of last follow-up was September 30, 2024. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the mPATH-Lung program, a digital health program delivered outside a clinical visit that included a brief decision aid and option to request a screening appointment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;669) or enhanced usual care, in which patients were notified of their lung cancer screening eligibility and advised to speak with their primary care clinician (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;664). The primary outcome was completion of any chest CT within 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes included screening decisions, process measures (screening visits, CT scans ordered), clinical outcomes (lung cancer screening results, lung cancers diagnosed), screening harms, and implementation outcomes. Electronic invitations were sent to 26&#x202f;909 individuals with a smoking history in their electronic health record; 3267 completed website eligibility questions and 1333 were deemed eligible and enrolled. The mean age was 60.7 years (SD, 6.8 years); 864 (65%) were female; 232 (17%) were Black and 1054 (79%) were non-Hispanic White; and 621 (47%) had commercial insurance and 595 (45%) had public insurance. Chest CT completion was higher in the mPATH-Lung group than in controls (24.5% [164/669] vs 17.0% [113/664]; odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1). Among patients who completed screening CT, false-positive results occurred in 12.7% (19/150) of mPATH-Lung participants and 8.4% (8/95) of controls. Invasive procedures were performed in 2.0% (3/150) in the intervention group and 1.1% (1/95) in the control group, with no complications. Compared with enhanced usual care, a direct-to-patient digital health intervention increased rates of lung cancer screening. Future research should assess the reach and effectiveness of digital lung cancer screening interventions across diverse populations and health care settings.

      "abstract_md": "Lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals (defined as people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancer cases worldwide. In the US, the annual incidence of lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals is 14.4 to 20.8 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in females and 4.8 to 12.7 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in males. Most lung cancers in nonsmoking individuals are histologically adenocarcinomas (60%-80%) with the remainder being squamous or adenosquamous (10%-20%) and rarely small cell lung cancer (&lt;10%). Risk factors include exposure to passive smoking, radon exposure, air pollution, asbestos, and history of lung cancer in a first-degree family member. Therapeutically targetable genomic variants, such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, are more common in tumors from nonsmoking individuals compared with those with a smoking history (defined as people who currently or formerly smoked) (43% vs 11% for EGFR and 12% vs 2% for ALK). In contrast, tumor mutation burden, the number of somatic mutations in a tumor cell, is lower in lung cancer among nonsmoking individuals (0-3 mutations/megabase [Mb] vs 0-30 mutations/Mb). Similar to individuals with a history of smoking, nonsmoking individuals with lung cancer may present with wheeze, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, or symptoms attributable to metastatic disease (eg, bone pain and headache) or be diagnosed with incidentally detected disease. The US Preventive Services Task Force does not currently recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomographic scans for nonsmoking individuals, although screening guidelines vary globally. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapies depending on stage, performance status, and molecular features of the tumor. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing should be performed on stage Ib to IIIa lung cancer tumor tissue from nonsmoking individuals because actionable genomic alterations, such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, are treated with targeted therapy such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors osimertinib or lorlatinib, respectively. Median survival among nonsmoking individuals with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIIb or higher) and actionable genomic alterations can exceed 3 to 5 years, while survival without these genomic alterations is similar to lung cancer in people with a history of smoking (1-2 years). Lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals accounts for 15% to 20% of lung cancer cases worldwide. Among patients with lung cancer, nonsmoking individuals are more likely to have genomic alterations such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, and these patients have improved survival when treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared with chemotherapy."

Nevertheless, North American guidelines state that it is reasonable to administer 60 days of oral anticoagulation to patients with new-onset AF after CABG, a moderate-strength recommendation (class 2a) based on evidence derived from nonrandomized clinical studies. To test the hypothesis that the incidence of new-onset AF within the first year after CABG is higher than suggested in the current literature and to assess AF burden. A prospective, multicenter cohort study in 2 academic cardiac surgery centers in Germany that involved 198 patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease or left main disease and no history of arrhythmias who received an insertable cardiac monitor during CABG for long-term continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were enrolled from November 2019 through November 2023 and were followed up for 1 year. Atrial fibrillation detected within a year of continuous monitoring using insertable cardiac monitors implanted during CABG. Cumulative incidence of new-onset AF within a year of surgery. Secondary outcomes were AF burden and clinical outcomes. A total of 1217 patients were assessed, and 1008 were excluded. Of the 198 patients enrolled (173 male [87.4%]; 25 female [12.6%]; mean age, 66 [SD, 9] years), 95 patients developed new-onset AF within the first year after CABG (cumulative incidence, 48%; 95% CI, 41%-55%). The median AF burden during the first year was 0.07% (IQR, 0.02%-0.23%) or 370 minutes. The median AF burden on days 1 through 7 was 3.65% (IQR, 0.95%-9.09%); on days 8 through 30, 0.04% (IQR, 0%-1.21%); and on days 31 through 365, 0% (IQR, 0%-0.0003%), corresponding to 368, 13, and 0 minutes, respectively. After discharge, 3 patients had an AF episode longer than 24 hours. Although the incidence of new-onset AF after CABG in this study was higher than previously reported, the AF burden in these patients was very low, especially after 30 days. The very low AF burden questions the current guideline recommendations that long-term oral anticoagulation should be considered in patients with new-onset AF after CABG."

      "abstract_md": "Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Efficacy of eltrombopag during the newly diagnosed phase of pediatric immune thrombocytopenia is unknown. To determine if the proportion of patients with a platelet response is significantly greater in patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia treated with eltrombopag than in those treated with standard therapy (first-line treatments). This phase 3, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients (aged 1-&lt;18 years) with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;30&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109/L who required pharmacological treatment but did not have severe bleeding or need a rapid increase in platelet count) from May 7, 2019, to January 25, 2024, at 23 centers participating in the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America. Final follow-up occurred on February 26, 2025. Eltrombopag was administered orally based on a standard dosing schedule (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;78) vs standard therapy (investigator choice of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or anti-D immunoglobulin) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40). The primary outcome was a sustained platelet response defined as 3 or more of 4 platelet counts greater than 50&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109/L during weeks 6 to 12 without rescue treatment. The secondary outcomes included bleeding scores, change in health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events. Of 118 pediatric patients (median age, 8 years [IQR, 4-12 years]; 49% were male), 63% experienced an initial treatment failure after observation or medical therapy. Enrollment ended after a planned interim analysis met a prespecified threshold for efficacy. Of 71 patients in the eltrombopag group, 46 (65% [95% CI, 54%-76%]) had a sustained platelet response compared with 13 of 37 patients (35% [95% CI, 20%-51%]) in the standard therapy group (between-group difference, 30% [95% CI, 11%-49%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002), which crossed the monitoring boundary for efficacy. Overall, there was no between-group difference in the number and type of adverse events. In pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia requiring pharmacological treatment, eltrombopag resulted in a higher rate of sustained platelet response compared with standard therapy. Eltrombopag may be an effective option for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia with nonsevere bleeding who warrant medical intervention.

      "abstract_md": "Approximately 27% of adults in the US and Canada report having ever used cannabis for medical purposes. An estimated 10.5% of the US population reports using cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical compound extracted from cannabis that does not have psychoactive effects, for therapeutic purposes. Conditions for which cannabinoids have approval from the US Food and Drug Administration include HIV/AIDS-related anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and certain pediatric seizure disorders. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported a small but significant reduction in nausea and vomiting from various causes (eg, chemotherapy, cancer) when comparing prescribed cannabinoids (eg, dronabinol, nabilone) with placebo or active comparators (eg, alizapride, chlorpromazine; standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.29 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.18]). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials among patients with HIV/AIDS reported that cannabinoids had a moderate effect on increasing body weight compared with placebo (SMD, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.92]). Evidence-based guidelines do not recommend the use of inhaled or high-potency cannabis (&#x2265;10% or 10 mg &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol [&#x394;9-THC]) for medical purposes. High-potency cannabis compared with low-potency cannabis use is associated with increased risk of psychotic symptoms (12.4% vs 7.1%) and generalized anxiety disorder (19.1% vs 11.6%). A meta-analysis of observational studies reported that 29% of individuals who used cannabis for medical purposes met criteria for cannabis use disorder. Daily inhaled cannabis use compared with nondaily use was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (2.0% vs 0.9%), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs 1.3%), and stroke (2.6% vs 1.0%). Evidence from randomized clinical trials does not support the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most conditions for which it is promoted, such as acute pain and insomnia. Before considering cannabis or cannabinoids for medical use, clinicians should consult applicable institutional, state, and national regulations; evaluate for drug-drug interactions; and assess for contraindications (eg, pregnancy) or conditions in which risks likely outweigh benefits (eg, schizophrenia or ischemic heart disease). For patients using cannabis or cannabinoids for treatment of medical conditions, clinicians should discuss harm reduction strategies, including avoiding concurrent use with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines, using the lowest effective dose, and avoiding use when driving or operating machinery. Evidence is insufficient for the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most medical indications. Clear guidance from clinicians is essential to support safe, evidence-based decision-making. Clinicians should weigh benefits against risks when engaging patients in informed discussions about cannabis or cannabinoid use."
