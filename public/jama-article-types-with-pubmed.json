      "abstract_md": "The efficacy and safety of guideline-recommended treatments for heart failure (HF) are uncertain in patients with Chagas disease. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction due to Chagas disease. From December 10, 2019, through September 13, 2023, patients with HF, confirmed diagnosis of Chagas disease, left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 600 pg/mL or greater (or B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] &#x2265;150 pg/mL) or 400 pg/mL or greater (or BNP &#x2265;100 pg/mL) if hospitalized for HF within the previous 12 months were screened at 83 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Statistical analysis was conducted between May and July 2025. Patients were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan (target dose, 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (target dose, 10 mg twice daily), in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point was a hierarchical composite outcome tested, in order, of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for HF, or relative change in NT-proBNP from baseline to 12 weeks. The primary analysis was done using a win ratio approach. Overall, 462 participants were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan and 460 to receive enalapril (mean [SD] age, 64.2 [10.8] years; 387 [42.0%] were female). Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 25.2 (18.4-33.2) months, cardiovascular death occurred in 110 patients (23.8% [18.3% wins in the hierarchical comparison]) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 117 patients (25.4% [17.5% wins]) in the enalapril group. A total of 102 patients (22.1% [7.7% wins]) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 111 (24.1% [6.9% wins]) in the enalapril group experienced a first hospitalization for HF. Patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group had a median (IQR) decrease in NT-proBNP of 30.6% (-54.3% to -0.9%) at 12 weeks, leading to 22.5% wins, while those in the enalapril group had a 5.5% (-31.9% to 37.5%) decrease (7.2% wins). The resulting stratified win ratio was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.28-1.82; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) for sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril. In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction due to Chagas disease, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril, but there was a greater reduction in NT-proBNP at 12 weeks in patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group.

      "abstract_md": "The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan lowered blood pressure (BP) among Black adults in a controlled environment, but to date, there are no grocery shopping strategies that replicated its health effects in a community setting. The Groceries for Black Residents of Boston to Stop Hypertension (GoFresh) trial was conducted to determine the effects of low sodium-DASH groceries on systolic BP. This parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in Boston from August 2022 to September 2025 among Black residents of urban communities with few grocery stores, a systolic BP of 120 to less than 150 mm Hg, a diastolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, and no hypertension treatment. Data were analyzed from June through October 2025. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of home-delivered, DASH-patterned groceries ordered weekly with dietitian counseling without emphasizing cost or three $500 stipends every 4 weeks intended for self-directed grocery shopping. The primary comparison was the difference in the 3-month change in model-estimated office systolic BP (based on 3 measurements over at least 2 visits) between interventions. Adherence was assessed via 24-hour urine collection. Secondary outcomes included diastolic BP, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c levels, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Maintenance of effects was assessed 3 months after intervention cessation. Among 180 participants, (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [13.3] years; 102 female [56.7%]; 180 self-reported Black [100%]; 12 Hispanic [6.7%]), 175 individuals (97.2%) completed the primary outcome assessment. Mean (SD) baseline systolic BP and diastolic BP were 130.0 (6.7) mm Hg and 79.8 (8.1) mm Hg. At 3 months, the mean systolic BP changed -5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.4, to-3.9 mm Hg) in the DASH-patterned group and -2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.1 to -0.4 mm Hg) in the self-directed group (difference in changes, -3.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to -0.8 mm Hg; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009). Compared with the self-directed group, after 3 months the DASH-patterned group changed mean diastolic BP by -2.4 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 mm Hg), urine sodium level by -545 mg/24 h (95% CI, -1041 to -50 mg/24 h), and LDL cholesterol by -8.0 mg/dL (95% CI, -13.7 to -2.3 mg/dL) (to convert LDL cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). Effects were not maintained 6 months after the intervention was initiated. No effects occurred in BMI or hemoglobin A1c level. In this study, a program of home-delivered, DASH-style groceries plus dietitian counseling decreased BP and LDL cholesterol levels beyond comparable monetary compensation. However, effects were not maintained after the intervention ended. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05121337."

      "abstract_md": "Keratinocyte carcinomas are skin cancers that arise from keratinocytes and are composed of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs). Keratinocyte carcinomas are common in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Approximately 5.4 million keratinocyte carcinomas are diagnosed in the US annually. Keratinocyte carcinomas are primarily located on the head and neck (40%-64% of BCCs; 35%-45% of cSCCs). BCC typically presents as a pink, smooth, raised lesion or a pink to red, flat lesion. cSCC typically presents as a red, scaly, flat lesion (in situ tumors) or a red, firm, raised lesion with scale or erosion (invasive tumors). UV light exposure is the primary cause, and lighter skin pigmentation and skin phototype (eg, skin that more easily burns) are the primary risk factors. Other risk factors include older age, male sex, indoor tanning, history of precancerous lesions (actinic keratoses), history of keratinocyte carcinomas, and immunosuppression (eg, organ transplant). In-office surgical excision or curettage and electrodessication (in which the tumor is scraped away using a curette and the wound base is cauterized) is typically performed by a dermatologist for keratinocyte carcinomas with lower risk of recurrence, including those that are nonrecurrent and have well-defined borders, small size, and location on the trunk and extremities. After surgical excision, approximately 3% of BCCs and 5% of cSCCs recur; after curettage and electrodessication, approximately 6% of BCCs and 2% of cSCCs recur. For keratinocyte carcinomas at higher risk of recurrence, in-office Mohs surgery (a technique in which a dermatologist with specialized training removes the tumor in stages and evaluates the entire surgical margin pathologically using a microscope after each stage to ensure complete tumor excision) is typically used. After Mohs surgery, approximately 4% of BCCs and 3% of cSCCs recur. Patients diagnosed with keratinocyte carcinoma are at high risk of additional keratinocyte carcinomas (approximately 40% within 5 years). Evidence-based prevention of keratinocyte carcinoma involves use of sunscreen. In a randomized clinical trial, use of daily sunscreen decreased cSCC risk (rate ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-0.99; 1587 cSCCs per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in controls vs 953 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in sunscreen group). Keratinocyte carcinoma, composed of BCC and cSCC, is the most common cancer in the US, with an estimated 5.4 million diagnoses annually. Most keratinocyte carcinomas are effectively treated with in-office surgical procedures. Patients with keratinocyte carcinoma are recommended to undergo a skin examination at least annually due to their high risk of developing additional skin cancers."

To assess whether early administration of levosimendan reduces the time to successful VA-ECMO weaning in patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 11 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. Between August 27, 2021, and September 10, 2024, 205 adult patients with acute cardiogenic shock who had started VA-ECMO in the preceding 48 hours were enrolled. Final follow-up was completed on November 10, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan, 0.15 &#x3bc;g/kg per minute, to be increased to 0.20 &#x3bc;g/kg per minute after 2 hours (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;101), or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;104). The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO-, mechanical ventilation-, and organ failure-free days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, serious adverse events, and all-cause 30- and 60-day mortality. Among the 205 randomized patients (median age, 58 [IQR, 50-67] years; 149 [72.7%] male), main cardiogenic shock etiologies were postcardiotomy (79 [38.5%]), acute myocardial infarction (56 [27.3%]), and myocarditis (28 [13.7%]). Treatment dose was increased to 0.20 &#xb1; 0.01 &#x3bc;g/kg per minute in 93% of patients receiving levosimendan and in 96% of those receiving placebo. Within 30 days, 69 of 101 patients (68.3%) had a successful ECMO weaning in the levosimendan group compared with 71 of 104 (68.3%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -12.8% to 12.7%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.39]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.92). In the levosimendan and placebo groups, respectively, median ECMO duration (5 [IQR, 4-7] days vs 6 [IQR, 4-11] days; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.53), mean ICU length of stay (18 [SD, 15] days vs 19 [SD, 15] days; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.42), and 60-day mortality (27.7% vs 25.0%; risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -9.0% to 15.3%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.78) did not differ significantly. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently with levosimendan (18 [17.8%] vs 9 [8.7%]; absolute risk difference, 9.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-18.1%]). Among patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock supported by VA-ECMO, early levosimendan administration did not significantly reduce the time to successful weaning of ECMO compared with placebo.

To investigate potential associations between prenatal exposure to acid-suppressive medication (histamine 2 [H2] receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) and neuropsychiatric disorders in children. Retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in the South Korean National Health Insurance Service database with births from January 2010 through December 2017, with follow-up of offspring through December 2023. Analyses were conducted using a propensity score-based overlap-weighted cohort and a sibling-matched cohort. Prenatal exposure to at least 1 prescription for a PPI or H2 receptor antagonist. Offspring neuropsychiatric disorders identified via International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, severe neuropsychiatric disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Of 3&#x202f;012&#x202f;992 mother-child pairs initially identified, 2&#x202f;777&#x202f;119 were included, with 507&#x202f;845 pairs exposed to prenatal acid-suppressive medication and were followed up a mean of 10.3 (SD, 2.3) years. In the overlap-weighted cohort (403&#x202f;658 mother-child pairs exposed and 403&#x202f;659 pairs unexposed to an acid-suppressive medication), respective risks among offspring exposed vs not exposed were 4.85% vs 4.25% for ADHD, 1.45% vs 1.33% for ASD, 1.25% vs 1.09% for intellectual disability, 0.94% vs 0.81% for severe neuropsychiatric disorder, and 0.30% vs 0.27% for obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the overlap-weighted cohort, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) following prenatal acid-suppressive medication exposure was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.12-1.17) for ADHD, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.03-1.11) for ASD, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09-1.18) for intellectual disability, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.10-1.21) for severe neuropsychiatric disorder, and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sibling-control analyses that included 157&#x202f;069 exposed and 164&#x202f;669 unexposed offspring revealed no significant associations between prenatal exposure and offspring outcomes. The adjusted HR for ADHD was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-1.02); for ASD, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92-1.04); intellectual disability, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.95-1.09); severe neuropsychiatric disorder, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.93-1.08); or obsessive-compulsive disorders, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.82-1.10). Exposure to acid-suppressive medication during pregnancy was not associated with children's risk of ADHD, severe neuropsychiatric disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, intellectual disability, or ASD in sibling-control analyses. Small associations were observed in overlap-weighted models; these may reflect confounding by shared familial factors."

However, two-thirds of children experience inadequate pain relief with ibuprofen monotherapy, and the efficacy of additive medications for moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain is unclear. To determine whether treatment with an opioid (hydromorphone) plus ibuprofen or nonopioid (acetaminophen [paracetamol]) plus ibuprofen decreased pain scores compared with ibuprofen alone. Two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials were conducted from April 2019 to March 2023 in 6 university-affiliated, tertiary care Canadian pediatric emergency departments. Children aged 6 to 17 years presenting with a nonoperative acute limb injury (&lt;24 hours) and a verbal numerical rating scale (vNRS) pain score of 5 or more out of 10 were enrolled. Date of final follow-up was March 22, 2023. The opioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, or ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone. In all groups, ibuprofen was dosed at 10 mg/kg (maximum, 600 mg). The acetaminophen dose was 15 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg), and the hydromorphone dose was 0.05 mg/kg (maximum, 5 mg). The primary efficacy outcome was self-reported vNRS pain score at 60 minutes post medication administration (score range, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]; minimal clinically important difference, 1.5). The primary safety end point was the proportion of children with any adverse event related to study drug administration. A total of 8098 children were screened for eligibility; 699 were randomized and 653 were included in the efficacy analyses. The opioid trial included 249 children: 110 randomized to ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, 70 to ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, and 69 to ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial included 450 children: 225 randomized to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen and 225 randomized to ibuprofen alone. The mean (SD) age of children in the 2 trials was 11.5 (3.5) years and 47.4% were female. The mean (SD) vNRS score at recruitment was 6.4 (1.8). In pooled analyses, mean (SD) vNRS scores 60 minutes after drug administration were 4.8 (2.6) in the ibuprofen plus hydromorphone group, 4.6 (2.4) in the ibuprofen plus acetaminophen group, and 4.6 (2.3) in the ibuprofen alone group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.78). Any adverse event occurred at higher rates in the ibuprofen plus hydromorphone group (28.2%) compared with the ibuprofen plus acetaminophen (6.1%) or ibuprofen alone groups (5.8%). No serious adverse events occurred. For children with acute nonoperative musculoskeletal injury, pain scores at 60 minutes after drug administration did not improve with ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen plus hydromorphone compared with ibuprofen alone. Adverse events were 4-fold more frequent with hydromorphone. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03767933."

      "abstract_md": "Mifepristone, used with misoprostol, is the most common abortion regimen in the US. It is also a focal point of reproductive health policy and politics, with controversy over its legal status and regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To characterize the FDA's decision-making with respect to the regulation of mifepristone, with a particular interest in the agency's rationale for establishing, maintaining, or modifying key components of its regulatory approach over time. Qualitative analysis of 5239 pages of FDA documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, including sponsors' Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) assessment reports, FDA review of these reports, internal memos, and regulatory correspondence (2011-2023), supplemented by a review of publicly available information. Review focused on FDA justifications for implementing, maintaining, or modifying postapproval safety measures and the supporting evidence cited. Five key moments in the FDA's regulation of mifepristone that have led to the current state of oversight were identified: (1) conversion to the REMS framework in June 2011; (2) reevaluation of REMS necessity in October 2013; (3) a sponsor-requested label change in May 2015; (4) the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021; and (5) a comprehensive reassessment of the REMS in November 2021. Key themes across this period were consistent findings on safety, lack of ideological bias in staff scientists' recommendations, and the limited impact of political interference-to date-on the agency's oversight. Even as litigation, the COVID-19 public health emergency, and evolving practice standards changed the context of mifepristone regulation, the agency generally followed the policy approach favored by scientists at the agency. FDA oversight of mifepristone, developed during key moments from 2011 to 2023, has been shaped by scientific evidence and a cautious regulatory approach led by scientists at the agency."

Many patients with HeFH do not achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals with the currently available lipid-lowering therapies. To evaluate the efficacy of enlicitide decanoate (an oral proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor) vs placebo in adults with HeFH requiring further lowering of LDL-C levels despite use of statin therapy. This phase 3, randomized clinical trial included persons aged 18 years or older with HeFH currently using lipid-lowering therapy (taking at least a moderate- or high-intensity statin) and either an LDL-C level of 55 mg/dL or greater and a history of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or greater without a history of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The trial was conducted at 59 sites across 17 countries; the first participant was screened on August 8, 2023, and the last follow-up visit occurred on April 7, 2025. Participants were randomized (2:1) to 20 mg of enlicitide (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;202) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;101) once daily for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 24. The secondary outcomes included the mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 52, the mean percentage change at week 24 in levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B, and the median percentage change at week 24 in lipoprotein(a). Of the 303 participants (mean age, 52.4 [SD, 13.5] years; 51% were female) randomized, 293 (96.7%) completed the trial. The mean LDL-C level was 119.0 mg/dL (SD, 41.0 mg/dL) at baseline, all had statin current use (81.5% were taking a high-intensity statin), and 64.4% were taking ezetimibe. The mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 24 was -58.2% in the enlicitide group vs 2.6% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -59.4% [95% CI, -65.6% to -53.2%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 52 was -55.3% in the enlicitide group vs 8.7% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -61.5% [95% CI, -69.4% to -53.7%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). At week 24, the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C level was -52.3% in the enlicitide group vs 2.1% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -53.0% [95% CI, -58.5% to -47.4%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), the mean percentage change in apolipoprotein B level was -48.2% vs 1.8%, respectively (between-group difference, -49.1% [95% CI, -54.0% to -44.3%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), and the median percentage change in lipoprotein(a) level was -24.7% vs -1.6% (between-group difference, -27.5% [95% CI, -34.3% to -20.6%]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and study discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between groups. Among adults with HeFH, treatment with enlicitide was well tolerated and significantly reduced levels of LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, non-HDL-C, and lipoprotein(a).

      "abstract_md": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) includes a range of liver conditions, progressing from isolated steatosis (characterized by fat accumulation in the liver without inflammation) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which involves fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver. The presence of MASLD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. The most common chronic liver disease worldwide, MASLD affects approximately 30% to 40% of the general adult population globally (with varying prevalence across continents), including approximately 60% to 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes and approximately 70% to 80% of those with obesity. It is typically diagnosed based on an ultrasonographic finding of hepatic steatosis, along with at least 1 of 5 features of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal overweight or obesity, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, hypertension, elevated level of plasma triglycerides, and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) for women who consume less than 140 g/wk of alcohol (&lt;2 standard drinks/d) and for men who consume less than 210 g/wk (&lt;3 standard drinks/d) and have no other known causes of steatosis such as use of a particular medication (eg, corticosteroids, tamoxifen, or methotrexate), hepatitis C, or iron overload. Other risk factors for MASLD include older age (&#x2265;50 years) and male sex (male:female ratio approximately 2). The Fibrosis-4 index (a scoring system incorporating age, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (a noninvasive imaging technique) are commonly used to stage hepatic fibrosis in patients with MASLD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by certain extrahepatic cancers (primarily gastrointestinal, breast, and gynecologic cancer) and liver-related complications, including cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding), and hepatocellular carcinoma. First-line treatment of MASLD involves behavioral modifications (including hypocaloric low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol) and management of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Bariatric surgery should be considered for patients with MASLD and a body mass index greater than 35. Resmetirom (a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor &#x3b2;-selective agonist) and subcutaneous semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) are conditionally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with MASH who have moderate to advanced fibrosis. A highly prevalent condition among adults worldwide, MASLD is associated with liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. First-line treatment includes behavioral modifications, including a weight-reducing diet, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol. Resmetirom and semaglutide are conditionally FDA-approved medications for the treatment of adults with MASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis."

      "abstract_md": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic condition, results in lifelong increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increases lifetime cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Most individuals with FH remain undiagnosed, so early FH identification and treatment could lower CVD burden. To evaluate the projected cost-effectiveness of population sequential FH screening (lipid testing followed by genetic testing after a high LDL-C measurement) at 10 or 18 years of age. The CVD Policy Model, a validated discrete event simulation of CVD risk factor management and CVD outcomes in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants, was used to simulate lifetime health and economic outcomes from a health care sector perspective for a hypothetical cohort of 4.2 million US 10-year-olds. Individual characteristics and health care processes informed CVD events (coronary heart disease or stroke) and survival probabilities. Model inputs included national data sources, clinical trials, pooled longitudinal cohort studies, and published literature. Usual care assumed only opportunistic lipid testing and LDL-C and CVD risk-guided treatment. When added to usual care, sequential FH screening strategies examined combinations of childhood (age 10 years) or early adulthood (age 18 years) screening with 3 LDL-C thresholds (&#x2265;130 mg/dL, &#x2265;160 mg/dL, or &#x2265;190 mg/dL) to select patients for genetic testing. Primary outcomes were direct health care costs (2021 US dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually. Strategies with an ICER of less than $100&#x202f;000 per QALY gained were considered cost-effective. For the simulated cohort, usual care would lead to 3&#x202f;118&#x202f;000 (95% uncertainty interval, 3&#x202f;061&#x202f;000-3&#x202f;192&#x202f;000) total lifetime CVD events, with 16&#x202f;182 (95% uncertainty interval, 15&#x202f;683-16&#x202f;827) among those with FH. Childhood FH screening could avert between 1385 and 1820 CVD events (&lt;0.1% reduction in overall population), and early adulthood FH screening could avert between 1154 and 1448 CVD events (&lt;0.1% reduction). While effective, no FH screening strategies were cost-effective relative to usual care; screening at age 18 years using an LDL-C threshold of 190 mg/dL or greater had the lowest ICER, at $289&#x202f;700 per QALY gained. Sequential FH screening could become cost-effective vs usual care if lifetime lipid monitoring plus lifestyle therapy increased after a high screening LDL-C result, including for patients with non-FH dyslipidemias. Sequential FH screening in childhood or early adulthood could be effective but not cost-effective vs usual care. However, sequential FH screening could become cost-effective under highly optimistic assumptions about increased lifestyle therapy and increased lifetime lipid monitoring for patients with non-FH dyslipidemias."

      "abstract_md": "Pancreas divisum is implicated as an obstructive cause for acute pancreatitis. Observational data suggest endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with minor papillotomy reduces the risk of pancreatitis episodes. Even though this endoscopic procedure is widely used in practice, clinical trials are lacking. To determine whether ERCP with minor papillotomy reduces the risk of acute pancreatitis among adults with unexplained acute recurrent pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. This multicenter, sham-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled adults with 2 or more episodes of acute pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. Adults with other etiologies for acute pancreatitis or concomitant chronic calcific pancreatitis were excluded. The trial was conducted between September 1, 2018, and August 30, 2024, at 21 referral centers in the US and Canada. Last follow-up occurred on February 15, 2025. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ERCP with minor papillotomy or sham ERCP. The primary outcome was development of acute pancreatitis more than 30 days after randomization as a time-to-event outcome. The secondary outcomes included acute pancreatitis episode frequency and development of chronic calcific pancreatitis, diabetes, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. A total of 148 participants were randomized (mean age, 54 [SD, 19.5] years; 68.2% female; 95.3% non-Hispanic or Latino and 87.2% White; mean lifetime acute pancreatitis episodes, 3 [SD, 2]; mean duct diameter, 2.2 [SD, 1.3] mm) and followed up for a median of 34 months (IQR, 21.7-45.7 months). Of the 75 participants in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group, 26 (34.7%) developed acute pancreatitis compared with 32 of 73 participants (43.8%) in the sham ERCP group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.41]). The incidence rate ratio for acute recurrent pancreatitis episode frequency was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.34) in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group vs 0.30 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.41) in the sham ERCP group. There were no between-group differences in frequency and incidence of chronic calcific pancreatitis (4.0% in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group vs 2.7% in the sham ERCP group; risk difference [RD], 0.01 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.07]), diabetes (15.8% vs 12.8%, respectively; RD, 0.03 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.19]), and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction (7.7% vs 17.2%; RD, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.27 to 0.08]). The adverse event of acute pancreatitis within 30 days of randomization occurred more frequently in the ERCP with minor papillotomy group (14.7%) vs the sham ERCP group (8.2%) (RD, 0.06 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.17]). Among patients with unexplained acute recurrent pancreatitis and pancreas divisum, ERCP with minor papillotomy does not reduce the risk of another episode of acute pancreatitis or related sequelae.

To determine whether prediction of first coronary events is improved by adding information on coronary atherosclerosis from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to a model using the pooled cohort equation (PCE) risk score tool and the coronary artery calcification score (CACS). Observational cohort study including individuals aged 50 to 64 years randomly recruited from the general population and examined at 6 university hospitals in Sweden from 2013 to 2018, with a median follow-up of 7.8 years. A sample of 30&#x202f;154 individuals underwent cardiopulmonary imaging, physical examinations, routine laboratory tests, questionnaires, and/or functional tests. This study included 24&#x202f;791 individuals without previous cardiovascular disease for whom high-quality CCTA images were available. Events were followed up via registers until September 2024. The information used from the CCTA images was the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (segment involvement score), presence of noncalcified atherosclerosis, and presence of coronary obstructive disease (stenosis &#x2265;50%). The outcome was a composite of first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. During follow-up, 304 coronary events occurred. Segment involvement scores of 3 to 4 and greater than 4 and presence of noncalcified atherosclerosis were associated with hazard ratios of 2.71 (95% CI, 1.34-5.44), 5.27 (95% CI, 2.50-11.07), and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.23-2.22), respectively. In a model based on the PCE and CACS, CCTA-derived data improved risk discrimination (C statistic improved from 0.764 to 0.779; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004) and risk reclassification (net reclassification improvement of 0.133 [95% CI, 0.031-0.165]), conferred a net correct upward reclassification of 14.2% in those with events and incorrectly classified 1.6% of participants not experiencing an event into a higher-risk category. Because of the low event rate in the cohort, reclassification mainly occurred in the group classified as at low risk (&lt;5%) according to the PCE. Information on coronary atherosclerosis from CCTA modestly improved risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors and CACS in identifying individuals at risk of coronary events and in need of primary prevention."

      "abstract_md": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in individuals with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure. However, their effects in those with stage 4 CKD or little to no albuminuria remain uncertain. To assess whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or degree of albuminuria, measured by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), modifies the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes. SGLT2 inhibitor trials participating in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium (SMART-C). Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials within SMART-C evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor with label indications for reducing CKD progression including at least 500 participants in each group with at least 6 months of follow-up. Treatment effects in individual trials were pooled using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. CKD progression, defined as kidney failure, at least 50% reduction in eGFR, or death due to kidney failure. Other outcomes included annual rate of eGFR decline and kidney failure. Among 70&#x202f;361 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.8 [8.7] years; 24&#x202f;595 [35.0%] females) in 10 randomized trials, 2314 (3.3%) experienced CKD progression and 988 (1.4%) reached kidney failure. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of CKD progression (25.4 vs 40.3 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.57-0.68]), irrespective of baseline eGFR (HR of 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.71] for eGFR &#x2265;60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47-0.70] for eGFR of 45 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 0.64 [95% CI, 0.54-0.75] for eGFR of 30 to &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2; and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60-0.83] for eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2; P for trend&#x2009;=&#x2009;.16) and baseline albuminuria (HR of 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44-0.76] for albuminuria &#x2264;30 mg/g; 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57-0.96] for &gt;30-300 mg/g; and 0.57 [95% CI, 0.52-0.64] for more than 300 mg/g; P for trend&#x2009;=&#x2009;.49). Although the magnitude of protection varied, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the annual rate of eGFR decline across all eGFR and UACR subgroups, including when participants with and without diabetes were analyzed separately. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of kidney failure alone (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58-0.75]). In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were found to lower the risk of CKD progression regardless of baseline eGFR or albuminuria, including in patients with stage 4 CKD or minimal albuminuria, supporting their routine use to improve kidney outcomes across the full spectrum of kidney function among patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure."

      "abstract_md": "There is uncertainty about the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in participants with chronic kidney disease, with guidelines offering different strengths of recommendation based on diabetes status and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). To assess the relative and absolute effects of SGLT2 inhibitor use across efficacy and serious safety outcomes in participants stratified by diabetes status and UACR (&#x2265;200 mg/g or &lt;200 mg/g). Included 8 randomized clinical trials that studied an SGLT2 inhibitor with a label indication for use in kidney disease and recorded longitudinal kidney outcomes and baseline data on albuminuria. Data were combined using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis; group-specific absolute effects were estimated by applying relevant relative risks to the event rates of the placebo groups. Assessed the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor use on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. Heterogeneity by baseline level of UACR was assessed separately by diabetes status. A total of 58&#x202f;816 participants (mean age, 64 [SD, 10] years; 35% were female; 48&#x202f;946 with diabetes and 9870 without diabetes) were included from trials comparing an SGLT2 inhibitor vs placebo. Allocation to an SGLT2 inhibitor produced a lower rate of kidney disease progression (33 vs 48 for placebo per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.60-0.70] in those with diabetes and 32 vs 46 per 1000; HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.85] in those without diabetes), a lower rate of acute kidney injury (14 vs 18 per 1000 [HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.87] with diabetes and 13 vs 18 per 1000 [HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92] without diabetes), a lower rate of any hospitalization (202 vs 231 per 1000 [HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.92] with diabetes and 203 vs 237 per 1000 [HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95] without diabetes), and a lower rate of any death (42 vs 47 per 1000 [HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91] with diabetes and 42 vs 48 per 1000 [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78-1.05] without diabetes). Diabetes-specific HRs were similar in participants (with a UACR &#x2265;200 mg/g vs with a UACR &lt;200 mg/g) considered separately. Higher absolute risk at a UACR of 200 mg/g or greater meant larger estimated absolute benefits on kidney disease progression were evident in this subgroup. Clear absolute benefits were evident for other efficacy outcomes, and particularly hospitalization, in participants with a UACR less than 200 mg/g. Net absolute benefits remained in the analyses of non-heart failure populations and when estimated glomerular filtration rate was less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Within the studied participants, there were clear absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney, hospitalization, and mortality outcomes irrespective of diabetes status and level of UACR."

      "abstract_md": "Peripheral neuropathy, defined as damage to peripheral nerves, affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide. More than 200 causes of peripheral neuropathy exist, with symptoms ranging in severity from mild toe numbness to debilitating symptoms that can require a wheelchair. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, affecting approximately 206 million people worldwide. Peripheral neuropathy is typically length-dependent, which means that symptoms appear in the longest nerve axons (toes) and progress proximally over time. Peripheral neuropathy is typically symmetric and affects sensory axons more than motor axons. Diabetic neuropathy, which is often associated with both sensory symptoms, such as pain, tingling, or numbness; mild weakness; and autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, accounts for more than 50% of peripheral neuropathy in Western populations. Other causes of neuropathy include hereditary causes, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, toxic neuropathy from medications (chemotherapies [eg, cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine], amiodarone, or HIV nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [eg, stavudine, zalcitabine]); alcohol; vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12; and monoclonal gammopathies. Up to 27% of adults with neuropathy have no identifiable etiology for their neuropathy after diagnostic testing. Recommended initial testing includes blood glucose (for diabetes), serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (for monoclonal gammopathies). First-line medications for neuropathic pain are the &#x3b1;2-&#x3b4; calcium channel subunit ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine and venlafaxine; and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitryptyline and nortriptyline. Pain often persists despite medical management. At least a 50% reduction in pain was observed in 38% of those with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy receiving 1200 mg of gabapentin daily. Combination drug therapies for neuropathic pain may provide added benefit. The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy depends on its underlying cause, but complete reversal of nerve damage is uncommon even in cases for which there are available treatments. Peripheral neuropathy affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide and may cause sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in Western countries. First-line therapies for neuropathic pain include gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and amitriptyline."

To determine the 10-year appendicitis recurrence and appendectomy rate in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis treated with antibiotics. Ten-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing appendectomy with antibiotics at 6 Finnish hospitals from November 2009 to June 2012, where 530 patients (aged 18-60 years) with uncomplicated acute appendicitis diagnosed by computed tomography were randomly assigned to appendectomy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;273) or antibiotics (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;257). Last follow-up was April 29, 2024. This current analysis focused on assessing the 10-year appendicitis recurrence rate among patients assigned to antibiotics. Open appendectomy vs antibiotics with intravenous ertapenem sodium (1 g/d) for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times/d). Prespecified 10-year secondary end points included late (after 1 year) appendectomy and appendicitis recurrence rate after antibiotics and complications. Post hoc outcomes included the detection of possible appendiceal tumors among patients in the antibiotic group undergoing appendectomy or with an intact appendix using magnetic resonance imaging. Additional post hoc outcomes were quality of life and patient satisfaction. At 10-year follow-up, 253/257 patients (98.4%) randomized to receive antibiotics (median age, 33 years; 102 [40.3%] female) were assessed for appendicitis recurrence, with a true appendicitis recurrence rate (appendicitis at histopathology) of 37.8% (95% CI, 31.6%-44.1% [87/230]) and a cumulative appendectomy rate of 44.3% (95% CI, 38.2%-50.4% [112/253]). Overall, the 10-year cumulative complication rate in the group randomized to appendectomy was 27.4% (95% CI, 21.6%-33.3% [62/226]) and 8.5% (95% CI, 4.8%-12.1% [19/224]) in the group randomized to receive antibiotics (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). There was no observed significant difference in quality of life between antibiotics and appendectomy (387/530; median health index value, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.0] for both groups; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.18). Among patients initially treated with antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the rate of recurrence and appendectomy at 10-year follow-up supports the use of antibiotics as an option for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

      "abstract_md": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related movement disorder that affects approximately 3% of US adults to a clinically significant extent and can cause substantial sleep disturbance. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an overwhelming urge to move the limbs, typically the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant limb sensations (eg, achiness, tingling). Symptoms, provoked by immobility, are relieved while moving and are typically present or most severe in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome symptoms may lead to difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or returning to sleep. According to population-based studies, approximately 8% of US adults experience RLS symptoms of any frequency annually and 3% experience moderately or severely distressing symptoms at least twice weekly. Patients with RLS have impaired quality of life and elevated rates of cardiovascular disease (29.6% with coronary artery disease, stroke, or heart failure), depression (30.4%), and suicidal ideation or self-harm (0.35 cases/1000 person-years). Restless legs syndrome is common among patients with multiple sclerosis (27.5%), end-stage kidney disease (24%), and iron deficiency anemia (23.9%); during pregnancy and especially in the third trimester (22%); with peripheral neuropathy (eg, diabetic, idiopathic; 21.5%); and with Parkinson disease (20%). Other risk factors include family history of RLS, northern European descent, female sex (2:1 vs male sex), and older age (RLS prevalence of 10% in adults &#x2265;65 years). Restless legs syndrome is diagnosed based on clinical history; polysomnography is not recommended for diagnosis. Iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate (325-650 mg daily or every other day) or intravenous iron (1000 mg) should be initiated for serum ferritin level less than or equal to 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation less than 20%. If possible, medications associated with RLS, including serotonergic antidepressants, dopamine antagonists, and centrally acting H1 antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine), should be discontinued. Gabapentinoids (eg, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin) are first-line pharmacologic therapy. In randomized clinical trials, approximately 70% of patients treated with gabapentinoids had much or very much improved RLS symptoms vs approximately 40% with placebo (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Dopamine agonists (eg, ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine) are no longer recommended as first-line medications due to the risk of augmentation, an iatrogenic worsening of RLS symptoms, which has an annual incidence of 7% to 10% with these medications. Patients who do not improve with first-line treatment or have augmented RLS often benefit from low-dose opioids (eg, methadone 5-10 mg daily). Restless legs syndrome affects approximately 3% of adults and can have negative effects on sleep and quality of life. Initial management includes cessation of exacerbating medications, as well as iron supplementation for patients with low-normal iron indices. If medication therapy is indicated, gabapentinoids are first-line treatment."

      "abstract_md": "For patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), cough impairs quality of life; effective treatments for IPF-associated cough are needed. To determine if nalbuphine extended release (ER), a &#x3ba; opioid receptor agonist and &#x3bc;-opioid receptor antagonist, decreases cough compared with placebo in patients with IPF-associated cough. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial conducted at 52 sites in 10 countries, patients with IPF, chronic cough for at least 8 weeks, and a Cough Severity Numerical Rating Scale (0, no cough; 10, worst possible cough) score of 4 or higher were enrolled from February 2024 to February 2025, with last follow-up in April 2025. Statistical analyses were conducted from May to August 2025. Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive nalbuphine ER at doses of 27 mg, 54 mg, or 108 mg or placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the relative change from baseline in 24-hour cough frequency (coughs/h), measured with a digital cough monitor, for nalbuphine ER compared with placebo at week 6. The key secondary outcome was the relative change from baseline in the patient-reported cough frequency (Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in IPF cough subscale; scores range from 0-4, lower scores indicate lesser cough frequency) at week 6. Of the 223 patients screened, 165 were randomized (42, 43, 40, and 40 to receive nalbuphine ER 27 mg, 54 mg, and 108 mg, and placebo, respectively) and 160 were included in the primary analysis (median age, 71 [range, 51-85] years; 28.5% female). The baseline mean (SD) cough count was 28.3 (27.4) coughs/h. In the nalbuphine ER 27 mg, 54 mg, and 108 mg twice-daily groups, the mean relative decrease in the cough count and the absolute decrease in coughs/h were 47.9% (from 24.6 to 11.9; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.008), 53.4% (from 28.0 to 14.9; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), and 60.2% (from 31.5 to 11.9; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), respectively, compared with placebo (16.9%; from 29.4 to 28.1 coughs/h). For the key secondary outcome of patient-reported cough frequency at week 6, the relative and absolute changes were -31.4% (from 2.3 to 1.5; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.14), -40.6% (from 2.6 to 1.4; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004), and -40.2% (from 2.4 to 1.4; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.005) in the 27-mg, 54-mg, and 108-mg groups, respectively, compared with -21.9% (from 2.6 to 1.9) with placebo. For patients with IPF-associated chronic cough, all 3 doses of nalbuphine ER reduced objective cough frequency and the 2 higher doses improved patient-reported cough frequency at 6 weeks.

To assess the feasibility of the REUP technique in adult DCD heart transplant, without regard to donor age or anticipated ischemic time. Case series of 24 patients to undergo REUP-recovered DCD adult heart transplant at a single high-volume heart transplant center in the United States from November 2024 to July 2025. REUP used for DCD cardiac allograft recovery without preimplant donor heart reanimation or machine perfusion. Severe primary graft dysfunction, 30-day survival, and acute rejection on first endomyocardial biopsy. Twenty-four REUP-recovered DCD hearts were transplanted, with a mean donor age of 32 years and 9 donors (38%) older than 40 years. Fifty percent of recipients had prior sternotomy. The mean time from initial declaration of donor death to flush was 9 minutes. Fifteen donor hearts (60%) had a total ischemic time longer than 4 hours, including 1 that was 8 hours. Among recipients, 30-day survival was 96%. Only 1 patient (4%) had severe primary graft dysfunction, and 1 other patient (4%) had secondary graft dysfunction. On initial endomyocardial biopsy, 1 patient (4%) had acute cellular rejection grade 2R; no cases of antibody-mediated rejection were observed. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of REUP for DCD heart recovery without donor heart reanimation in a broad population of donors and recipients and without regard to anticipated ischemic time. Given the high cost and complexity of current DCD heart recovery strategies, as well as ethical concerns surrounding normothermic regional perfusion, REUP may prove to be a promising procurement method. Further study is required to support continued expansion of this novel technique."

      "abstract_md": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a chronic kidney disease involving deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes in the glomerulus, causing glomerular inflammation and scarring. It is the most common immune-mediated glomerular disease worldwide, and affects an estimated 198&#x202f;887 to 208&#x202f;184 persons in the US. Up to 50% of patients with IgAN develop kidney failure within 10 years of diagnosis. IgAN typically presents with nephritic syndrome and usually occurs in younger adults, with a mean age at diagnosis of 34 to 45 years. Incidence is highest in East Asia. Approximately 60% of cases are detected incidentally with hematuria or proteinuria on urinalysis. Up to 30% of patients present with episodic visible hematuria, often concomitantly with an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection (synpharyngitic hematuria). Less common presentations include nephrotic syndrome (&lt;5%) and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (&lt;5%). When IgAN is suspected (due to hematuria, proteinuria, or reduced kidney function), initial workup should include quantification of proteinuria and assessment for other causes of nephritic syndrome (eg, lupus nephritis). Adults with suspected IgAN and proteinuria greater than or equal to 0.5 g per day should undergo kidney biopsy. The diagnosis of primary IgAN is based on presence of IgA-dominant immune deposits in the glomerular mesangium after excluding other causes of this histologic appearance, ie, IgA vasculitis, IgA-dominant infection-related glomerulonephritis, and secondary IgAN from diseases such as cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, infection (eg, viral hepatitis), and autoimmune diseases (eg, axial spondyloarthritis). Based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of IgAN, treatment for patients with proteinuria greater than 0.5 g per day includes behavioral modifications (eg, dietary sodium &lt;2 g/d, smoking cessation, weight control, exercise), antihypertensive medications for goal blood pressure less than 120/70 mm Hg, and therapies to reduce the formation of IgA-containing immune complexes (eg, targeted-release budesonide), decrease glomerular injury (eg, systemic glucocorticoids, iptacopan), and manage existing IgAN-induced nephron loss (eg, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor or dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist [eg, sparsentan] alone or in combination with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor). IgAN is the leading cause of immune-mediated glomerular disease worldwide. Patients with suspected IgAN and proteinuria greater than or equal to 0.5 g per day should undergo kidney biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of IgAN includes behavioral modifications, blood pressure management, and therapies to decrease formation of IgA-containing immune complexes (eg, targeted-release budesonide), reduce immune complex-mediated glomerular injury (eg, systemic glucocorticoids, iptacopan), and manage IgAN-induced nephron loss (eg, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor)."

      "abstract_md": "Approximately 27% of adults in the US and Canada report having ever used cannabis for medical purposes. An estimated 10.5% of the US population reports using cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical compound extracted from cannabis that does not have psychoactive effects, for therapeutic purposes. Conditions for which cannabinoids have approval from the US Food and Drug Administration include HIV/AIDS-related anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and certain pediatric seizure disorders. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported a small but significant reduction in nausea and vomiting from various causes (eg, chemotherapy, cancer) when comparing prescribed cannabinoids (eg, dronabinol, nabilone) with placebo or active comparators (eg, alizapride, chlorpromazine; standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.29 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.18]). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials among patients with HIV/AIDS reported that cannabinoids had a moderate effect on increasing body weight compared with placebo (SMD, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.92]). Evidence-based guidelines do not recommend the use of inhaled or high-potency cannabis (&#x2265;10% or 10 mg &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol [&#x394;9-THC]) for medical purposes. High-potency cannabis compared with low-potency cannabis use is associated with increased risk of psychotic symptoms (12.4% vs 7.1%) and generalized anxiety disorder (19.1% vs 11.6%). A meta-analysis of observational studies reported that 29% of individuals who used cannabis for medical purposes met criteria for cannabis use disorder. Daily inhaled cannabis use compared with nondaily use was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (2.0% vs 0.9%), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs 1.3%), and stroke (2.6% vs 1.0%). Evidence from randomized clinical trials does not support the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most conditions for which it is promoted, such as acute pain and insomnia. Before considering cannabis or cannabinoids for medical use, clinicians should consult applicable institutional, state, and national regulations; evaluate for drug-drug interactions; and assess for contraindications (eg, pregnancy) or conditions in which risks likely outweigh benefits (eg, schizophrenia or ischemic heart disease). For patients using cannabis or cannabinoids for treatment of medical conditions, clinicians should discuss harm reduction strategies, including avoiding concurrent use with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines, using the lowest effective dose, and avoiding use when driving or operating machinery. Evidence is insufficient for the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most medical indications. Clear guidance from clinicians is essential to support safe, evidence-based decision-making. Clinicians should weigh benefits against risks when engaging patients in informed discussions about cannabis or cannabinoid use."

Coffee is the most commonly consumed caffeinated beverage in the US, and a randomized trial assessing caffeinated coffee consumption in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not previously been performed. To determine the effect of caffeinated coffee consumption compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeine on recurrent AF. This was a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 200 current or previous (within past 5 years) coffee-drinking adults with persistent AF, or atrial flutter with a history of AF, planned for electrical cardioversion from 5 hospitals in the US, Canada, and Australia between November 2021 and December 2024. The date of final follow-up was June 5, 2025. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to regular caffeinated coffee consumption vs coffee and caffeine abstinence for 6 months. Patients in the coffee consumption group were encouraged to drink at least 1 cup of caffeinated coffee daily. Patients in the abstinence group were encouraged to completely abstain from both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and other caffeine-containing products. The primary end point was clinically detected recurrence of AF or atrial flutter over 6 months. Two hundred patients (mean [SD] age, 69 [11] years; 71% male) were randomized to caffeinated coffee consumption (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) or coffee abstinence (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100). Baseline coffee intake was 7 cups (IQR, 7-18) per week in both groups. During follow-up, coffee intake in the consumption and abstinence groups was 7 (IQR, 6-11) and 0 (IQR, 0-2) cups per week, respectively, resulting in a between-group difference of 7 cups (95% CI, 7-7) per week. In the primary analysis, AF or atrial flutter recurrence was less in the coffee consumption (47%) than the coffee abstinence (64%) group, resulting in a 39% lower hazard of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.42-0.89]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). A comparable benefit of coffee consumption was observed with AF recurrence only. There was no significant difference in adverse events. In this clinical trial of coffee drinkers after successful cardioversion, allocation to consumption of caffeinated coffee averaging 1 cup a day was associated with less recurrence of AF or atrial flutter compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeinated products.

To assess the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention for achieving self-reported continuous tobacco abstinence at 6 months, supported by biochemical verification at 6 months, compared with usual care in people with TB. Multicenter, cluster randomized clinical trial conducted between September 18, 2023, and January 2, 2025, randomizing (2:1) 27 TB clinics in Bangladesh and Pakistan to mHealth or usual care groups. The follow-up was 6 months. Participants were eligible if they were 15 years or older, had been diagnosed with drug-sensitive pulmonary TB in the past 4 weeks, smoked daily, were willing to quit, and had access to mobile phones. The mHealth group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;720) received text messages throughout TB treatment, daily for 2 months then monthly for 4 months, encouraging tobacco cessation. The usual care group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;360) received written information on tobacco cessation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous abstinence at 6 months, verified biochemically using carbon monoxide breath test at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported point abstinence at 9 weeks and 6 months, TB treatment adherence (days receiving TB treatment), TB treatment success (cured&#x2009;+&#x2009;completed treatment), TB treatment failure, TB treatment default (interruption of TB treatment for &#x2265;2 months), and death. Of 9232 patients assessed for eligibility, 1080 were randomized; most were male (mHealth, 96.9%; usual care, 95.8%), and 985 were retained throughout the trial (91%). For the primary outcome, 300 of 720 participants (41.7%) in the mHealth group demonstrated self-reported and biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months, compared with 55 of 360 (15.3%) in the usual care group (risk ratio, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.0-4.9]). In the mHealth vs usual care groups, respectively, mean TB treatment adherence was 174.3 (SD, 21.5) days vs 178.0 (SD, 12.1) days (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.23), and treatment success was 89.3% vs 85.6% (risk ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.9-1.6]). TB treatment failure (0.1% vs 0.5%) and default (3.1% vs 1.9%) were uncommon. Mortality was lower with mHealth (3.5%) vs usual care (7.5%) (hazard ratio, 0.4 [95%CI, 0.2-0.9]). An mHealth intervention was effective in achieving continuous abstinence in people with TB who smoked. mHealth is a feasible and effective intervention to help patients with TB quit smoking. isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN86971818."

      "abstract_md": "For patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury, persistent need for dialysis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high health care use, and poor quality of life. To test the effect of a conservative dialysis strategy on recovery of kidney function. This multicenter, unblinded, randomized superiority trial enrolled participants with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury who had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, had already initiated kidney replacement therapy, and were hemodynamically stable, with planned intermittent hemodialysis between January 23, 2020, and March 10, 2025, at 4 clinical sites in the United States. Of 909 patients assessed for eligibility, 221 were randomized and 220 received the allocated intervention. The date of last follow-up was June 10, 2025. With the conservative dialysis strategy, participants received dialysis only when specific metabolic or clinical indications were met. Participants in the conventional dialysis group received dialysis 3 times per week until urine output or creatinine clearance criteria were met. The primary study end point was unadjusted kidney function recovery at hospital discharge, defined as being alive and not receiving dialysis, with at least 14 consecutive days without dialysis (including after discharge). Two prespecified key secondary end points were the number of dialysis sessions per week and the number of dialysis-free days to day 28. The mean age of participants was 56 years (SD, 16 years). A total of 148 of 220 participants (67%) were male, 28 (13%) were Black, and 133 (60%) were White. Mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 64.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD, 30.9 mL/min/1.73 m2). Participants had started kidney replacement therapy a median of 9 days (IQR, 5-18.5 days) before randomization. In the conservative dialysis intervention group, 70 of 109 participants (64%) achieved kidney function recovery at hospital discharge vs 55 of 109 participants (50%) in the conventional dialysis control group (difference, 13.8% [95% CI, 0.8%-26.8%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.02-3.03; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04]; after prespecified adjustment: odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.86-2.84; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.15]). Participants in the conservative dialysis group received fewer dialysis sessions per week (median, 1.8 [IQR, 0-2.6] vs 3.1 [IQR, 2.6-3.5]; difference, -1.4 [95% CI, -1.8 to -1.0]) and recovered earlier (21 [IQR, 0-28] vs 5 [IQR, 0-21] consecutive dialysis-free days to day 28; difference, 16 days [95% CI, 5-27]). Dialysis-associated hypotension occurred less frequently in the conservative dialysis group (69 vs 97 events). A conservative dialysis strategy in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury resulted in a shorter time to and higher rates of recovery of kidney function in the unadjusted analysis. Given uncertainty regarding the estimated effect size, this approach should be tested in a larger study population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04218370."

In 2022, there were an estimated 107 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 101-113) million adults living with obesity in the US (42.5% [95% UI, 40.2%-45.0%] of the adult population), an increase from 34.7 (95% UI, 31.1-38.3) million in 1990 (19.3% [95% UI, 17.3%-21.3%] of the adult population). By 2035, this is projected to increase to 126 (95% UI, 118-134) million (46.9% [95% UI, 43.9%-49.9%] of the adult population). Nationally, age-standardized prevalence by race and ethnicity group and sex in 2022 ranged from 40.1% (95% UI, 37.8%-42.5%) for non-Hispanic White males to 56.9% (95% UI, 54.1%-59.9%) for non-Hispanic Black females. There were substantial state-level differences, with prevalence highest in Midwestern and Southern states, as well as within-state disparities by race and ethnicity, which were larger for females than males. Prevalence also varied by age, with obesity prevalence highest among middle-aged adults and large increases in the youngest adult ages, especially for females. While there are large differences by race and ethnicity, sex, age, and state, the prevalence of obesity is high and forecasted to continue increasing for all groups."

Although electronic health record (EHR)-based tools can increase use of evidence-based medications, their ability to reduce prescription of potentially inappropriate medications remains unclear. To test the effects of 2 EHR interventions, designed using behavioral science techniques, on the deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications compared with usual care in older patients. In this 3-group parallel randomized clinical trial, 201 primary care physicians (PCPs) in an academic center in Massachusetts were cluster-randomized in November 2022. Follow-up ended March 15, 2024. The intervention focused on patients of randomized PCPs who were 65 years or older, had a PCP visit between November 10, 2022, and March 15, 2024, and were prescribed at least 90 pills of benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, or at least 2 anticholinergic medications in the past 180 days. PCPs were randomized to usual care (no intervention) or to 1 of 2 sequential EHR **Interventions:** a precommitment intervention, in which an EHR message was sent to the physician during the first patient visit asking the PCP to initiate deprescribing discussions with a second reminder EHR message at the patient's second visit encouraging deprescribing; and a boostering intervention, in which PCPs received a notification encouraging deprescribing at the first patient visit and an in-basket reminder 4 weeks later. The primary outcome was deprescribing at least 1 medication on or after the first patient visit though the end of follow-up. Deprescribing was defined as physician-directed discontinuation or medication tapering assessed at the patient level using EHR data. Generalized estimating equations with a log link and binary-distributed errors were used for analyses, adjusting for clustering and multiple testing using Holm-Bonferroni corrections. Of 1146 participants (mean age, 73.6 years [SD, 6.4]; 69.7% female, mean follow-up, 289.9 days), 373 (32.5%) had at least 1 medication deprescribed: 145 (36.8%) in the precommitment group, 122 (34.3%) in the boostering group, and 106 (26.8%) in usual care. Compared with usual care, deprescribing was 40% more likely (relative risk [RR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.14-1.73; absolute difference, 10.4%) in the precommitment group and 26% more likely (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57; absolute difference, 6.5%) in the boostering group. No serious adverse events were reported through the adverse event reporting system. Death rates based on manual chart review were 1.4% in the precommitment group, 3.9% in the boostering group, and 1.8% in the usual care group. These results support use of EHR tools designed using behavioral science principles to significantly increase rates of deprescribing potentially inappropriate medications used by older adults.
