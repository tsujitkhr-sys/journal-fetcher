Resource capacity limits widespread adoption. Biparametric MRI, which omits the gadolinium contrast sequence, is a shorter and cheaper alternative offering time-saving capacity gains for health systems globally. To assess whether biparametric MRI is noninferior to multiparametric MRI for diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer. A prospective, multicenter, within-patient, noninferiority trial of biopsy-naive men from 22 centers (12 countries) with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) from April 2022 to September 2023, with the last follow-up conducted on December 3, 2024. Participants underwent multiparametric MRI, comprising T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences. Radiologists reported abbreviated biparametric MRI first (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted), blinded to the DCE sequence. After unblinding, radiologists reported the full multiparametric MRI. Patients underwent a targeted biopsy with or without systematic biopsy if either biparametric MRI or multiparametric MRI was suggestive of clinically significant prostate cancer. The primary outcome was the proportion of men with clinically significant prostate cancer. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of men with clinically insignificant cancer. The noninferiority margin was 5%. Of 555 men recruited, 490 were included for primary outcome analysis. Median age was 65 (IQR, 59-70) years and median PSA level was 5.6 (IQR, 4.4-8.0) ng/mL. The proportion of patients with abnormal digital rectal examination findings was 12.7%. Biparametric MRI was noninferior to multiparametric MRI, detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in 143 of 490 men (29.2%), compared with 145 of 490 men (29.6%) (difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4] percentage points; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.50). Biparametric MRI detected clinically insignificant cancer in 45 of 490 men (9.2%), compared with 47 of 490 men (9.6%) with the use of multiparametric MRI (difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4] percentage points). Central quality control demonstrated that 99% of scans were of adequate diagnostic quality. In men with suspected prostate cancer, provided image quality is adequate, an abbreviated biparametric MRI scan, with or without targeted biopsy, could become the new standard of care for prostate cancer diagnosis. With approximately 4 million prostate MRIs performed globally annually, adopting biparametric MRI could substantially increase scanner throughput and reduce costs worldwide.

Myo-inositol supplementation may reduce these risks. To determine whether daily supplementation with myo-inositol during pregnancy among individuals with PCOS reduces the risk of a composite outcome of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted at 13 hospitals in the Netherlands. Pregnant individuals with PCOS who were between 8 and 16 weeks' gestation were enrolled between June 2019 and March 2023. Final follow-up was complete on December 27, 2023. Analyses were conducted July 2024. Participants were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive sachets with either myo-inositol, 2 g, with 0.2 mg of folic acid twice daily (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;230) or matching placebo with 0.2 mg of folic acid only (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;234) until delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation). Among 464 participants, the mean (SD) age was 31.5 (3.8) years; 18 participants (3.9%) reported Asian race and 395 (86.1%) reported White race. The prevalence of biochemical hyperandrogenism was higher at baseline in the myo-inositol group than the placebo group (29.0% [53 of 180] vs 18.5% [37 of 193]). A primary outcome event occurred in 25.0% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56) of participants in the myo-inositol group and 26.8% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;61) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.68-1.28]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.67). Myo-inositol supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the incidence of a composite of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or preterm birth in patients with PCOS. onderzoekmetmensen.nl Identifier: NL67329.078.18."

From November 17, 2021, through January 17, 2024, thirty-five Swedish hospitals grouped into 18 clusters were randomized to a sequence of 1 year with routine H pylori screening of all patients with acute myocardial infarction followed by a washout period of 2 months before crossing over to 1 year with usual care or vice versa. Patients were followed up until January 17, 2025. Routine addition of H pylori screening by urea breath test to standard care in all patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction during the screening periods. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, analyzed by a negative binomial model in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 18&#x202f;466 patients (median age, 71 years [IQR, 61-79], 13&#x202f;138 males [71%]) with myocardial infarction were followed up: 9245 during the screening periods and 9221 during the nonscreening periods. At admission, 2284 during the screening periods and 2275 during the nonscreening periods (both 24.7%) reported proton pump inhibitor use. During screening periods, 6480 patients (70%) had undergone testing, of those 1532 (23.6%) tested positive for H pylori. After a median follow-up of 1.9 years, 299 patients in the screening group (incidence rate, 16.8 events per 1000 person-years; cumulative hazard at 3 years, 4.1%) and 336 in the usual care group (incidence rate, 19.2 events per 1000 person-years; cumulative hazard at 3 years, 4.6%) experienced the primary end point of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (rate ratio [RR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77-1.05; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.18). Predefined nonmultiplicity adjusted subgroup analyses showed a heterogeneous intervention effect; for no anemia (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.80-1.21), mild anemia (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98), and moderate to severe anemia (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.87; P for interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03). Among unselected patients with acute myocardial infarction, routine H pylori screening did not significantly reduce the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

      "abstract_md": "Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100&#x202f;000 people, resulting in approximately 200&#x202f;000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year. Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection. In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100&#x202f;000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon."

The development of new strategies to delay asphyxiation is crucial to improve survival rates. To investigate the efficacy of a novel, user-carried avalanche safety device that delivers airflow from avalanche debris to the user's airway without requiring supplemental oxygen or a mouthpiece. This randomized, blinded, clinical trial was organized by 4 institutions and conducted at 1 field location in Italy from January to March 2023. Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years were enrolled. Trial participants underwent a critical snow burial simulation while in a prone position covered by at least 50 cm of snow. Vital parameters were continuously monitored throughout the simulation to ensure participant safety and to collect physiological data. Participants were randomized to the safety device group (using the Safeback SBX device) or the control group (using a sham device). The safety device group completed an unblinded control in which the participants who remained buried after 35 minutes were seamlessly transferred to the sham device. The primary outcome measure was the time to oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) less than 80% (event) during 35 minutes of monitoring, comparing intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes included oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations at different distances in the snow. Of 36 randomized participants, 24 performed and completed the trial and were included in the final analysis. The median (IQR) age was 27 (25-32) years, and 13 (54%) were male. In the safety device group, the median (IQR) burial duration was 35.0 (35.0-35.0) minutes and there were no events; in the control group, the median (IQR) burial duration was 6.4 (4.8-13.5) minutes and there were 7 events. The safety device group had a significantly lower risk of termination due to Spo2 less than 80% (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001 for both log-rank and Breslow tests). Carbon dioxide in the air pocket was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%) vs 6.1% (95% CI, 5.1%-7.1%) and oxygen was 19.8% (95% CI, 19.5%-20.1%) vs 12.4% (95% CI, 11.2%-13.5%) at the same points in the safety device and control groups, respectively. A user-carried avalanche safety device that delivers airflow from avalanche debris to the user's airways without requiring supplemental oxygen delayed critical hypoxemia and hypercapnia during simulated critical burial.

Nevertheless, North American guidelines state that it is reasonable to administer 60 days of oral anticoagulation to patients with new-onset AF after CABG, a moderate-strength recommendation (class 2a) based on evidence derived from nonrandomized clinical studies. To test the hypothesis that the incidence of new-onset AF within the first year after CABG is higher than suggested in the current literature and to assess AF burden. A prospective, multicenter cohort study in 2 academic cardiac surgery centers in Germany that involved 198 patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease or left main disease and no history of arrhythmias who received an insertable cardiac monitor during CABG for long-term continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were enrolled from November 2019 through November 2023 and were followed up for 1 year. Atrial fibrillation detected within a year of continuous monitoring using insertable cardiac monitors implanted during CABG. Cumulative incidence of new-onset AF within a year of surgery. Secondary outcomes were AF burden and clinical outcomes. A total of 1217 patients were assessed, and 1008 were excluded. Of the 198 patients enrolled (173 male [87.4%]; 25 female [12.6%]; mean age, 66 [SD, 9] years), 95 patients developed new-onset AF within the first year after CABG (cumulative incidence, 48%; 95% CI, 41%-55%). The median AF burden during the first year was 0.07% (IQR, 0.02%-0.23%) or 370 minutes. The median AF burden on days 1 through 7 was 3.65% (IQR, 0.95%-9.09%); on days 8 through 30, 0.04% (IQR, 0%-1.21%); and on days 31 through 365, 0% (IQR, 0%-0.0003%), corresponding to 368, 13, and 0 minutes, respectively. After discharge, 3 patients had an AF episode longer than 24 hours. Although the incidence of new-onset AF after CABG in this study was higher than previously reported, the AF burden in these patients was very low, especially after 30 days. The very low AF burden questions the current guideline recommendations that long-term oral anticoagulation should be considered in patients with new-onset AF after CABG."

To evaluate whether individualized vs routine perioperative blood pressure management during major abdominal surgery improves clinical outcomes in patients considered at high risk of postoperative complications. This randomized single-blind clinical trial enrolled patients 45 years or older undergoing elective major abdominal surgery with general anesthesia expected to last 90 minutes or longer who had at least 1 additional high-risk criterion between February 26, 2023, and April 25, 2024, at 15 German university hospitals. The date of last follow-up was July 25, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to individualized perioperative blood pressure management (with mean arterial pressure [MAP] targets based on preoperative mean nighttime MAP assessed using automated blood pressure monitoring) or routine blood pressure management with a MAP target of 65 mm Hg or higher. The primary outcome was the incidence of a composite outcome of acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within the first 7 postoperative days. There were 22 secondary outcomes, including infectious complications within the first 7 postoperative days and a composite outcome of need for kidney replacement therapy, myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within 90 days after surgery. Of the 1272 patients enrolled, 1142 were randomized (571 patients to each group), and 1134 were included in the primary analysis (median age, 66 years [IQR, 59-73 years]; 34.1% female). The primary outcome occurred in 190 of 567 patients (33.5%) assigned to individualized blood pressure management and 173 of 567 patients (30.5%) assigned to routine blood pressure management (relative risk, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.93-1.30]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.31). None of the 22 secondary outcomes were significantly different, including infectious complications within the first 7 postoperative days (90/567 [15.9%] vs 97/567 [17.1%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.63) and a composite outcome of need for kidney replacement therapy, myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within 90 days after surgery (32/566 [5.7%] vs 20/567 [3.5%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.12). Among patients at high risk of postoperative complications undergoing major abdominal surgery, individualized perioperative blood pressure management with MAP targets based on preoperative mean nighttime MAP did not decrease the composite outcome of acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within the first 7 postoperative days compared with routine blood pressure management with a MAP target of 65 mm Hg or higher.

To determine whether intraoperative blood pressure management stratified by risk of hypotension reduces postoperative functional disability compared with usual care in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery. In this randomized clinical trial, adults undergoing elective noncardiac surgery at 2 tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands were enrolled from June 17, 2021, to February 7, 2024. The date of last follow-up was October 24, 2024. Patients were randomized 1:1 to proactive blood pressure management with mean arterial pressure targets based on risk of intraoperative hypotension (low risk, &#x2265;70 mm Hg; intermediate risk, &#x2265;80; high risk, &#x2265;90) or usual management at their anesthesiologist's discretion, generally aiming to avoid a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg without higher predefined targets. The primary outcome was functional disability at 6 months, assessed with the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0; scale range, 0-100; higher scores indicate more disability). A minimally clinically important difference of 5 points was prespecified. There were 23 secondary outcomes, including quality of life, complications, and mortality within 6 months. The trial was stopped early for futility after 3247 of 5000 planned patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 44-69]; 1738 female [53.5%]) were enrolled. A total of 677 patients (21%) were low risk; 1814 (56%), intermediate risk, and 756 (23%), high risk. Baseline median WHODAS scores were 12.5 [IQR, 4.2-29.2] in proactive group and 14.6 [IQR, 4.2-29.2] in standard group). At 6 months, mean (SD) WHODAS scores were 17.7 (20.1) in the proactive group and 18.2 (20.5) in the standard group (mean difference, -0.5; 95% credible interval, -1.9 to 0.9). There were no significant differences in any of the 23 secondary outcomes. Intraoperative blood pressure management with mean arterial pressure goals stratified by risk of hypotension did not improve functional disability at 6 months postoperatively compared with standard intraoperative blood pressure management.

      "abstract_md": "Data from randomized clinical trials on a long-term anticoagulation strategy for patients after catheter-based ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) are lacking. To evaluate whether discontinuing oral anticoagulant therapy provides superior clinical outcomes compared with continuing oral anticoagulant therapy in patients without documented atrial arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation for AF. A randomized clinical trial including 840 adult patients (aged 19-80 years) who were enrolled and randomized from July 28, 2020, to March 9, 2023, at 18 hospitals in South Korea. Enrolled patients had at least 1 non-sex-related stroke risk factor (determined using the CHA2DS2-VASc score [range, 0-9]) and no documented recurrence of atrial arrhythmia for at least 1 year after catheter ablation for AF. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used as an assessment of stroke risk among patients with AF (calculated using point values for congestive heart failure, hypertension, &#x2265;75 years of age, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, between 65 and 74 years of age, and sex category). The date of final follow-up was June 4, 2025. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;417) or continue oral anticoagulant therapy (with direct oral anticoagulants; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;423). The primary outcome was the first occurrence of a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding at 2 years. Individual components of the primary outcome (such as ischemic stroke and major bleeding) were assessed as secondary outcomes. Of the 840 adults randomized, the mean age was 64 (SD, 8) years, 24.9% were women, the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.1 (SD, 1.0), and 67.6% had paroxysmal AF. At 2 years, the primary outcome occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) in the discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy group vs 8 patients (2.2%) in the continue oral anticoagulant therapy group (absolute difference, -1.9 percentage points [95% CI, -3.5 to -0.3]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02). The 2-year cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 0.3% in the discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy group vs 0.8% in the continue oral anticoagulant therapy group (absolute difference, -0.5 percentage points [95% CI, -1.6 to 0.6]). Major bleeding occurred in 0 patients in the discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy group vs 5 patients (1.4%) in the continue oral anticoagulant therapy group (absolute difference, -1.4 percentage points [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.2]). Among patients without documented atrial arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation for AF, discontinuing oral anticoagulant therapy resulted in a lower risk for the composite outcome of stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding vs continuing direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

      "abstract_md": "Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer and cancer death in women worldwide. In 2022, ovarian cancer was diagnosed in approximately 324&#x202f;398 individuals, and 206&#x202f;839 died of ovarian cancer worldwide. In 2025, it is estimated that 20&#x202f;890 US women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 12&#x202f;730 patients will die of ovarian cancer. Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial malignancies, of which 70% to 80% are high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Less common epithelial subtypes include endometrioid, clear cell, low-grade serous, mucinous, and carcinosarcoma. The median age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer is 63 years. Risk factors include older age, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and nulliparity. Hereditary factors are associated with 25% of cases, predominantly linked to BRCA1/2 gene variants. At diagnosis, approximately 95% of patients experience nonspecific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and urinary urgency and frequency, and about 80% have advanced-stage disease (stage III-IV), including extrapelvic disease, ascites, and abdominal masses. Diagnostic and staging evaluation includes pelvic ultrasound; computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and serum tumor markers such as carbohydrate antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen. First-line treatment for early-stage ovarian cancer, defined as limited to the ovary or fallopian tube (stage I) or confined to the pelvis (stage II), is surgery (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and lymphadenectomy), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel). With treatment, early-stage ovarian cancer has a 5-year overall survival of 70% to 95%. Advanced-stage ovarian cancer may be treated with primary cytoreductive surgery (removal of all visible cancer in the abdominal cavity) and adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Most patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer receive maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis) and/or poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. With treatment, the 5-year overall survival rate for advanced-stage ovarian cancer is 10% to 40%. However, individuals with BRCA-related gene variants have a 5-year overall survival rate of approximately 70% with PARP inhibitor treatment. Despite an initial remission rate of 80%, approximately 75% of patients with advanced-stage disease have ovarian cancer relapse within 2 years. Approximately 21&#x202f;000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer annually in the US, and approximately 80% have advanced-stage ovarian cancer at diagnosis. First-line treatment of early-stage ovarian cancer is surgery and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Treatment of advanced-stage ovarian cancer includes cytoreductive surgery, platinum-based chemotherapy, and targeted maintenance therapies such as bevacizumab and/or PARP inhibitors."

      "abstract_md": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major cause of hospitalization, often occurring in patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although early trials of semaglutide and tirzepatide have shown promising results in improving symptoms, those findings were based on few clinical events, leaving treatment recommendations uncertain. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of semaglutide and tirzepatide in patients with cardiometabolic HFpEF in clinical practice. Five cohort studies using national US health care claims data from 2018 to 2024. Two cohort studies emulated the STEP-HFpEF DM (semaglutide) and SUMMIT (tirzepatide) trials to benchmark results. Eligibility criteria were then expanded to evaluate treatment effects in patients typically treated in clinical practice. Finally, a head-to-head comparison of tirzepatide and semaglutide was implemented. Follow-up was up to 52 weeks. New use of semaglutide, tirzepatide, or sitagliptin as a placebo proxy. The primary end point was a composite of hospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. Negative control outcomes, secondary end points, subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were prespecified. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by fitting proportional hazards models with propensity score weighting to adjust for a comprehensive set of pretreatment patient characteristics. Benchmarking of the 2 trial emulations demonstrated high agreement on all prespecified metrics. In analyses using expanded eligibility criteria, 58&#x202f;333 patients were included in the semaglutide vs sitagliptin cohort, 11&#x202f;257 for tirzepatide vs sitagliptin, and 28&#x202f;100 for tirzepatide vs semaglutide. Initiators of semaglutide (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.51-0.65]) and tirzepatide (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.31-0.57]) had substantially lower risk of the primary end point compared with sitagliptin. Tirzepatide had no meaningfully lowered risk compared with semaglutide (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.70-1.06]). Negative controls, secondary end points, subgroups, and sensitivity analyses showed consistent results. No substantially increased risk was observed for select safety end points. In patients with cardiometabolic HFpEF, semaglutide and tirzepatide showed more than 40% risk reduction for the composite of hospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality compared with a placebo proxy. Tirzepatide showed no meaningful benefit over semaglutide. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT06914102, NCT06914154, NCT06914141."

      "abstract_md": "Preterm infants with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109/L) frequently receive platelet transfusions. However, it is unclear in what cases prophylactic transfusion truly reduces bleeding risk or whether it does more harm than good. To develop and validate a dynamic prediction model for major bleeding or mortality if prophylactic platelet transfusion were or were not to be given to infants with severe thrombocytopenia. The dynamic prediction model was developed in an international multicenter cohort (2017-2021) comprising 14 neonatal intensive care units in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany. Model evaluation was performed in a national multicenter cohort (2010-2014) including 7 Dutch neonatal intensive care units. The study population consisted of infants with severe thrombocytopenia less than 34 weeks' gestation. Two transfusion strategies were contrasted at each prediction point: receiving a platelet transfusion within 6 hours (prophylaxis) vs no platelet transfusion for 3 days (no prophylaxis). The primary outcome was the 3-day risk of major bleeding or mortality, reestimated every 2 hours during the first week after severe thrombocytopenia onset. Predictors included gestational and postnatal age, small-for-gestational-age infant, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive agents, platelet count, and prior platelet transfusion(s). Landmarking combined with the clone-censor-weight approach enabled dynamic prediction under the 2 transfusion strategies, accounting for time-varying confounding. Model performance was evaluated in the external validation cohort. In both the development (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1042) and validation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;637) cohorts, the median gestational age was 28 weeks and median birth weight was 900 g; there were 613 (59%) and 370 (58%) males, respectively. Major bleeding or death occurred in 235 infants (23%) in the development cohort and 135 (21%) in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.76) for the prophylaxis strategy and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92) for the no prophylaxis strategy, with calibration plots showing good calibration. Estimated risks under both strategies varied considerably depending on the infant's clinical condition at the time of prediction. Among preterm infants with severe thrombocytopenia, this modeling study found substantial variation among individuals in predicted benefits and harms of prophylactic platelet transfusion based on their current clinical characteristics. The dynamic prediction model performed well in a validation cohort, and its value to support individualized decisions warrants evaluation in future studies."

Worldwide, an estimated 8 million adults aged 18 to 49 years acquired syphilis in 2022. From 2019 to 2023, US syphilis cases increased by 61% overall, with diagnoses among females increasing by 112% and congenital syphilis cases increasing by 106%. Syphilis is transmitted via contact with infectious lesions during vaginal, anal, or oral sex or via the placenta during pregnancy. Individuals at increased risk for syphilis include people with HIV, those engaging in condomless sex with multiple partners, and men who have sex with men (MSM)-who comprised one-third (32.7%) of all males with primary and secondary syphilis in 2023. Early syphilis is defined as syphilis in the first year after infection and includes symptomatic (primary and secondary) and asymptomatic (early latent) stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by painless anogenital lesions. Secondary syphilis is associated with a diffuse rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Syphilis diagnosed more than a year after infection is referred to as late syphilis and includes asymptomatic (late latent) and symptomatic (tertiary) stages. Neurosyphilis, which can occur at any stage, can lead to meningitis, uveitis, hearing loss, or stroke. In pregnancy, up to 40% of fetuses with in-utero exposure to syphilis are stillborn or die from their infection during infancy. The diagnosis of syphilis relies on serologic reactivity along with a clinical history and presentation consistent with active or latent syphilis infection. The recommended treatment for syphilis is benzathine penicillin G administered as intramuscular doses of 2.4 million units: a single injection for early stage and 3 weekly injections for late latent stage syphilis. Strategies to identify and prevent syphilis infections include (1) screening of sexually active people aged 15 to 44 years at least once and at least annually for those at increased risk, (2) screening 3 times in pregnant individuals (at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester, and at delivery), (3) counseling about condom use, and (4) offering doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (200-mg doxycycline taken within 72 hours after sex as postexposure prophylaxis) to MSM and transgender women with a history of a sexually transmitted infection in the past year. Syphilis infections, including congenital syphilis, have increased in the US and worldwide over the past decade. First-line treatment for syphilis is benzathine penicillin G. Routine syphilis screening of all pregnant patients and all sexually active people aged 15 to 44 years and use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis in individuals at risk for syphilis infection are recommended strategies to decrease syphilis transmission."

To determine whether a direct-to-patient digital health program increases lung cancer screening. Randomized clinical trial enrolling individuals aged 50 to 77 years who met Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services criteria for lung cancer screening between April 18, 2022, and May 30, 2023, at 2 academic health systems in the southeastern US. The date of last follow-up was September 30, 2024. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the mPATH-Lung program, a digital health program delivered outside a clinical visit that included a brief decision aid and option to request a screening appointment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;669) or enhanced usual care, in which patients were notified of their lung cancer screening eligibility and advised to speak with their primary care clinician (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;664). The primary outcome was completion of any chest CT within 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes included screening decisions, process measures (screening visits, CT scans ordered), clinical outcomes (lung cancer screening results, lung cancers diagnosed), screening harms, and implementation outcomes. Electronic invitations were sent to 26&#x202f;909 individuals with a smoking history in their electronic health record; 3267 completed website eligibility questions and 1333 were deemed eligible and enrolled. The mean age was 60.7 years (SD, 6.8 years); 864 (65%) were female; 232 (17%) were Black and 1054 (79%) were non-Hispanic White; and 621 (47%) had commercial insurance and 595 (45%) had public insurance. Chest CT completion was higher in the mPATH-Lung group than in controls (24.5% [164/669] vs 17.0% [113/664]; odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1). Among patients who completed screening CT, false-positive results occurred in 12.7% (19/150) of mPATH-Lung participants and 8.4% (8/95) of controls. Invasive procedures were performed in 2.0% (3/150) in the intervention group and 1.1% (1/95) in the control group, with no complications. Compared with enhanced usual care, a direct-to-patient digital health intervention increased rates of lung cancer screening. Future research should assess the reach and effectiveness of digital lung cancer screening interventions across diverse populations and health care settings.

      "abstract_md": "Lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals (defined as people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancer cases worldwide. In the US, the annual incidence of lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals is 14.4 to 20.8 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in females and 4.8 to 12.7 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in males. Most lung cancers in nonsmoking individuals are histologically adenocarcinomas (60%-80%) with the remainder being squamous or adenosquamous (10%-20%) and rarely small cell lung cancer (&lt;10%). Risk factors include exposure to passive smoking, radon exposure, air pollution, asbestos, and history of lung cancer in a first-degree family member. Therapeutically targetable genomic variants, such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, are more common in tumors from nonsmoking individuals compared with those with a smoking history (defined as people who currently or formerly smoked) (43% vs 11% for EGFR and 12% vs 2% for ALK). In contrast, tumor mutation burden, the number of somatic mutations in a tumor cell, is lower in lung cancer among nonsmoking individuals (0-3 mutations/megabase [Mb] vs 0-30 mutations/Mb). Similar to individuals with a history of smoking, nonsmoking individuals with lung cancer may present with wheeze, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, or symptoms attributable to metastatic disease (eg, bone pain and headache) or be diagnosed with incidentally detected disease. The US Preventive Services Task Force does not currently recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomographic scans for nonsmoking individuals, although screening guidelines vary globally. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapies depending on stage, performance status, and molecular features of the tumor. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing should be performed on stage Ib to IIIa lung cancer tumor tissue from nonsmoking individuals because actionable genomic alterations, such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, are treated with targeted therapy such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors osimertinib or lorlatinib, respectively. Median survival among nonsmoking individuals with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIIb or higher) and actionable genomic alterations can exceed 3 to 5 years, while survival without these genomic alterations is similar to lung cancer in people with a history of smoking (1-2 years). Lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals accounts for 15% to 20% of lung cancer cases worldwide. Among patients with lung cancer, nonsmoking individuals are more likely to have genomic alterations such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, and these patients have improved survival when treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared with chemotherapy."

      "abstract_md": "Effective and well-tolerated pharmacotherapies for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, are needed. To determine the dose-response relationship of MM120 (lysergide D-tartrate) in adults with moderate to severe GAD. This phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 198 adults aged 18 to 74 years with a primary GAD diagnosis who presented with moderate to severe symptoms (defined by a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A] score &#x2265;20) and was conducted at 22 outpatient psychiatric research sites in the US from August 2022 to August 2023. The anxiety and depression end point assessments were conducted by independent central raters who were blinded to the trial protocol, treatment allocation, and study visit date. The last date of follow-up was November 27, 2023. Participants were randomized to receive a single (freebase equivalent) treatment dose with 25 &#xb5;g (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;39), 50 &#xb5;g (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40), 100 &#xb5;g (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40), or 200 &#xb5;g (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) of MM120 or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;39). The primary outcome was a dose-response relationship assessed using the multiple comparison procedure modeling (MCP-Mod) method for change in HAM-A score at 4 weeks (score range, 0-56; higher scores indicate greater severity; &#x2264;7 indicates no or minimal anxiety; 8-14, mild; 15-23, moderate; and &#x2265;24, severe). The minimal clinically important difference was 2.5 points. Of the 198 participants randomized, 194 were included in the full analysis set (mean age, 41.3 [SD, 13.6] years; 56.7% were female; and 3.6% were Asian, 7.7% were Black or African American, and 83.0% were White). The dose-response relationship assessed using the MCP-Mod method for change in HAM-A score at week 4 was statistically significant for the 100-&#xb5;g and the 200-&#xb5;g dose groups vs placebo (least-squares mean difference, -5.0 points [95% CI, -9.6 to -0.4 points] with 100 &#xb5;g of MM120 and -6.0 points [95% CI, -9.8 to -2.0 points] with 200 &#xb5;g of MM120) but the 25-&#xb5;g and 50-&#xb5;g dose groups did not reach significance vs placebo (least-squares mean difference, -1.2 points [95% CI, -6.0 to 3.5 points] with 25 &#xb5;g of MM120 and -1.8 points [95% CI, -7.6 to 4.0 points] with 50 &#xb5;g of MM120). The adverse events were consistent with the expected effects of MM120. The most common adverse events were visual perceptual changes (illusion, pseudo-hallucination, and visual hallucination), which occurred in 46.2% of participants who received 25 &#xb5;g of MM120, in 75.0% who received 50 &#xb5;g, in 92.5% who received 100 &#xb5;g, in 100% who received 200 &#xb5;g, and in 10.3% who received placebo; nausea occurred in 7.7%, 27.5%, 40.0%, 60.0%, and 7.7%, respectively; and headache occurred in 12.8%, 22.5%, 35.0%, 27.5%, and 23.1%. In participants with moderate to severe GAD, a single dose of MM120 produced a dose-dependent reduction in anxiety. These results support the dose-dependent efficacy of MM120 and inform the dose selection for phase 3 pivotal trials. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05407064."

      "abstract_md": "Studies suggest that everolimus may reduce the risk of rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) after heart transplant. Everolimus use is controversial because of data demonstrating higher infection deaths when everolimus is introduced de novo after transplant. It is unclear whether everolimus is safe and effective when initiated at 6 months posttransplant in children, a population in which median graft survival is limited to 15 years and randomized clinical trials are lacking. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of everolimus combined with low-dose tacrolimus to prevent major adverse transplant events (MATEs) in children after heart transplant. Multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial enrolling 211 patients who were alive 6 months after pediatric heart transplant at 25 US sites from February 2018 to August 2020. The last date of follow-up was April 17, 2023. Participants were randomized to receive everolimus and low-dose tacrolimus (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;107) or standard-dose tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;104) for 30 months. The primary efficacy end point was the MATE-3 score at 30 months, a validated composite ordinal end point including acute cellular rejection, CAV, and CKD. The primary safety end point was the MATE-6 score, encompassing the MATE-3 score plus antibody-mediated rejection, infection, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Among 211 children randomized, the mean age was 8.2 (SD, 6.3) years, 97 (46%) underwent transplant for congenital heart disease, and 49 (23%) were treated for rejection before 6 months. At 30 months, the mean MATE-3 score did not differ between the 2 treatment groups (mean difference, -0.32; 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.20; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.16). The mean MATE-6 score was no higher in the everolimus group than in the mycophenolate group (baseline-adjusted mean difference, -0.40; 95% CI, -1.81 to 0.93), meeting the success criterion for safety (noninferiority margin &lt;3). There were no differences in graft survival, MATE-free survival, or freedom from any individual MATE. Everolimus was associated with greater improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate at 12 months (mean difference, 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI, 1.09-19.91 mL/min/1.73 m2) and a lower incidence of CMV infection (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26-0.93). Among 6-month pediatric heart transplant survivors, everolimus and low-dose tacrolimus did not differ from tacrolimus and mycophenolate in preventing the composite of cellular rejection, CAV, and CKD at 30 months. However, everolimus and low-dose tacrolimus appear to be safe based on the total burden of 6 MATEs and may be associated with improved kidney function and less CMV infection. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03386539."

      "abstract_md": "Early-onset gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is typically defined as GI cancer diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years. The incidence of early-onset GI cancer is rising globally, and early-onset GI cancers represent the most rapidly increasing early-onset cancer in the US. Worldwide, among early-onset GI cancers reported in 2022, colorectal cancer (CRC) was the most common (54.3%; 184&#x202f;709 cases), followed by gastric cancer (23.8%; 80&#x202f;885 cases), esophageal cancer (13.2%; 45&#x202f;056 cases), and pancreatic cancer (8.6%; 29&#x202f;402 cases). In the US, among early-onset GI cancers reported in 2022, 20&#x202f;805 individuals were diagnosed with early-onset CRC, 2689 with early-onset gastric, 2657 with early-onset pancreatic, and 875 with early-onset esophageal cancer. Most early-onset GI cancers are associated with modifiable risk factors including obesity, poor-quality diet (eg, sugar-sweetened beverages, ultraprocessed foods), sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. Nonmodifiable risk factors include family history, hereditary syndromes (eg, Lynch syndrome), and inflammatory bowel disease for patients with early-onset CRC. Approximately 15% to 30% of early-onset GI cancers have pathogenic germline variants in genes such as DNA mismatch repair genes and BRCA1/2. All patients with early-onset GI cancers should undergo germline and somatic genetic testing to guide treatment, screen for other cancers (eg, endometrial cancer in Lynch syndrome), and assess familial risk. Treatment for early-onset GI cancers is similar to later-onset GI cancers and may include chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and therapies such as poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-associated pancreatic cancer. Compared with GI cancers diagnosed after age 50 years, patients with early-onset GI cancers typically receive more treatments but often have similar or shorter survival. Specialized centers and multidisciplinary teams can support patients with challenges around fertility preservation, parenting with cancer, financial difficulty, and psychosocial distress. Currently, screening is not recommended for most early-onset GI cancers, although in the US, screening for CRC is recommended for average-risk individuals starting at age 45 years. High-risk individuals (eg, those with Lynch syndrome, a first-degree relative with CRC, or advanced colorectal adenoma) should begin CRC screening earlier, at an age determined by the specific risk factor. Early-onset GI cancers, typically defined as cancer diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years, are among the largest subset of early-onset cancers globally. Treatment is similar to later-onset GI cancers and typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, depending on the cancer type and stage. The prognosis for patients with early-onset GI cancers is similar to or worse than that for patients with later-onset GI cancers, highlighting the need for improved methods of prevention and early detection."

Participants were randomized to receive and return an ECG patch monitor by postal mail (intervention, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2520) or usual care (control, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2520). Intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of participants with AF recorded in primary care records within 2.5 years postrandomization. Exploratory outcomes included exposure to oral anticoagulation and stroke. Of the 22&#x202f;044 individuals invited, 5040 (22.9%) were randomized. The participants' mean (SD) age was 78 (6) years, 47% were female, and the median (IQR) CHA2DS2VASc score was 4 (3-5). A total of 2126 participants (84.4%) wore and returned the patch. AF was detected by patch in 89 participants (4.2%), 55% of whom had an AF burden less than 10%. After 2.5 years, a postrandomization record of AF was present in 172 individuals (6.8%) in the intervention group vs 136 (5.4%) in the control group (ratio of proportions, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02-1.57]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03), with consistent results in prespecified subgroups. Mean exposure to oral anticoagulation by 2.5 years was 1.63 months (95% CI, 1.50-1.76) in the intervention group and 1.14 months (95% CI, 1.01-1.26) in the control group (difference, 0.50 months [95% CI, 0.24-0.75]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Stroke occurred in 69 participants (2.7%) in the intervention group and 64 (2.5%) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.76-1.53]). In this remote randomized clinical trial, mail-based AF screening with an ECG patch in older patients at moderate to high risk of stroke led to a modest long-term increase in AF diagnosis at 2.5 years.

Efficacy of eltrombopag during the newly diagnosed phase of pediatric immune thrombocytopenia is unknown. To determine if the proportion of patients with a platelet response is significantly greater in patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia treated with eltrombopag than in those treated with standard therapy (first-line treatments). This phase 3, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients (aged 1-&lt;18 years) with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;30&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109/L who required pharmacological treatment but did not have severe bleeding or need a rapid increase in platelet count) from May 7, 2019, to January 25, 2024, at 23 centers participating in the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America. Final follow-up occurred on February 26, 2025. Eltrombopag was administered orally based on a standard dosing schedule (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;78) vs standard therapy (investigator choice of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or anti-D immunoglobulin) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40). The primary outcome was a sustained platelet response defined as 3 or more of 4 platelet counts greater than 50&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;109/L during weeks 6 to 12 without rescue treatment. The secondary outcomes included bleeding scores, change in health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events. Of 118 pediatric patients (median age, 8 years [IQR, 4-12 years]; 49% were male), 63% experienced an initial treatment failure after observation or medical therapy. Enrollment ended after a planned interim analysis met a prespecified threshold for efficacy. Of 71 patients in the eltrombopag group, 46 (65% [95% CI, 54%-76%]) had a sustained platelet response compared with 13 of 37 patients (35% [95% CI, 20%-51%]) in the standard therapy group (between-group difference, 30% [95% CI, 11%-49%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002), which crossed the monitoring boundary for efficacy. Overall, there was no between-group difference in the number and type of adverse events. In pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia requiring pharmacological treatment, eltrombopag resulted in a higher rate of sustained platelet response compared with standard therapy. Eltrombopag may be an effective option for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia with nonsevere bleeding who warrant medical intervention.

      "abstract_md": "The permanent metallic occluders used for atrial septal defect (ASD) closure are associated with risks of late complications and may impede access to the left atrium. Bioresorbable occluders have the potential to address these limitations but have yet to be validated in randomized clinical trials. To evaluate whether a bioresorbable occluder is noninferior to a metallic occluder based on its efficacy and safety for transcatheter ASD closure. This multicenter, noninferiority, open-label randomized clinical trial included participants with secundum ASD. Enrollment occurred from May 8, 2021, to August 3, 2022, at 10 hospital sites in China. The 2-year follow-up period ended in September 2024. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a bioresorbable occluder (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;116) or a metallic occluder (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;114). The primary outcome was the success rate of ASD closure at 6 months (closure success was defined as procedural success with a residual shunt diameter of &#x2264;2 mm, which was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography). At the 2-year follow-up, the occluder groups were compared regarding the success of ASD closure and the device-related adverse events. The degradation profile of the bioresorbable occluder was assessed at 2 years. Of the 230 participants randomized, implantation was not attempted in 1 participant in the bioresorbable occluder group due to a small femoral vein, leaving 229 (median age, 14.1 years [IQR, 7.0 to 37.3 years]; 68% were female). At 6 months, the success rate of ASD closure was 96.5% (111 of 115 patients) for the bioresorbable occluder group vs 97.4% (111 of 114 patients) for the metallic occluder group (between-group difference, -0.8 percentage points [95% CI, -5.0 to 3.7]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001 for noninferiority). At 2 years, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in ASD closure success (94.8% [109/115] in the bioresorbable occluder group vs 96.5% [110/114] in the metallic occluder group; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.75), or in device-related adverse events (2.6% [3/115] vs 3.5% [4/114], respectively; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.72). The rate of degradation at 2 years was approximately 99.8% for the bioresorbable occluder. A bioresorbable occluder is noninferior to a metallic occluder for ASD closure, with near-complete degradation by 2 years. These findings suggest that a bioresorbable occluder could be a valuable addition to the options for transcatheter ASD closure. chictr.org.cn Identifier: ChiCTR2100044408."

Closed-loop insulin systems improve glycemia outside of pregnancy but have had limited testing in pregnancy. To assess the efficacy of a closed-loop system in pregnancy. Open-label trial enrolling pregnant women with type 1 diabetes at 14 clinical centers in Canada and Australia before 14 weeks' gestation with follow-up until 6 weeks postpartum. Enrollment occurred between June 2021 and July 2024 and follow-up was completed in March 2025. Participants were randomized 1:1 to closed-loop therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) or standard care (insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45) with continuous glucose monitoring. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in the pregnancy-specific glucose range (63-140 mg/dL), measured by continuous glucose monitoring from 16 to 34 weeks' gestation. Among 94 enrolled participants, 3 experienced pregnancy loss prior to randomization, 91 were randomized (mean age, 31.7 [SD, 5.2] years; early pregnancy hemoglobin A1c, 7.4% [SD, 1.0%]), and 88 were included in the primary analysis. The mean percentage of time spent in the pregnancy-specific glucose range from 16 to 34 weeks' gestation was 65.4% in the closed-loop group and 50.3% in the standard care group (mean adjusted difference, 12.5 [95% CI, 9.5-15.6] percentage points; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). There was 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia in the closed-loop group, and there were 2 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in the closed-loop group and 1 in the standard care group. Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using a closed-loop system spent significantly more time in the pregnancy-specific glucose range than those receiving standard care. These findings support the use of this closed-loop system in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04902378."

      "abstract_md": "Prediabetes is common, yet evidence-based lifestyle interventions are underutilized. To determine whether referral to an exclusively artificial intelligence (AI)-led lifestyle intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is noninferior to referral to a human-led DPP in achieving recommended thresholds for weight loss, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, and weekly physical activity among adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity. This phase 3, parallel-group, pragmatic, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 11, 2021, to December 16, 2024 (last follow-up) at 2 US clinical sites in Baltimore, Maryland, and Reading, Pennsylvania. Adults 18 years or older with prediabetes and overweight or obesity were enrolled. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a referral to an AI-powered DPP lifestyle intervention delivered via a mobile app and Bluetooth-enabled digital scale or a referral to a human coach-led DPP lifestyle intervention delivered remotely. Both interventions were delivered independently of the study team over a 12-month period. The primary outcome was a composite of maintaining an HbA1c less than 6.5% throughout the study and achievement of at least 5% weight loss, at least 4% weight loss plus at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity (assessed with actigraphy), or an absolute reduction in HbA1c of at least 0.2 percentage points at 12 months. Noninferiority of referral to the AI-led DPP compared with referral to the human-led DPP was prespecified to be determined if the 1-sided 95% CI lower boundary of the risk difference did not cross -15%. A total of 368 participants were included (median [IQR] age, 58 [50-65] years; 71% were female, 27% were Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 61% were White; median [IQR] BMI, 32.3 [28.5-37.1]). After referral, 171 of 183 participants (93.4%) initiated the AI-led DPP and 153 of 185 (82.7%) initiated the human-led DPP. The primary outcome was achieved by 58 of 183 participants (31.7%) in the AI-led DPP group and 59 of 185 (31.9%) in the human-led DPP group (risk difference, -0.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -8.2%]), meeting the criterion for noninferiority. Findings were consistent across individual components of the composite end point and in sensitivity analyses. Among adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity, referral to a fully automated AI-led DPP was noninferior to referral to a human-led DPP in achieving a composite outcome based on weight reduction, physical activity, and HbA1c.

Multiple small randomized clinical trials showed that a combination of budesonide with surfactant compared with surfactant alone reduced BPD or death. To determine if early intratracheal administration of a combination of budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) mixed with surfactant, compared with surfactant alone, reduces physiologic BPD or death by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in extremely preterm infants. This double-masked randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 2021 to June 2024 in the 17 centers of the United States Neonatal Research Network. Infants 22 to 28 weeks' gestation or 401 to 1000 g birth weight were enrolled after clinical decision to give surfactant, with the first dose of surfactant being study drug (prior surfactant was an exclusion criterion). Infants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive 1 to 2 doses of budesonide&#x2009;+&#x2009;surfactant (poractant alfa) or surfactant alone via endotracheal tube within 50 hours of birth. The primary outcome was physiologic BPD or death by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. There were 5 prespecified secondary outcomes and multiple prespecified exploratory and safety outcomes. The trial was stopped with 641 infants enrolled (55.3% of 1160 planned; mean birth weight, 810 g [SD, 256 g]; gestational age, 25.9 weeks [SD, 1.9 weeks]), because interim analysis at 50% enrollment reached the prespecified futility threshold. The incidence of BPD or death was 68.5% in the budesonide&#x2009;+&#x2009;surfactant group and 67.9% in the surfactant-alone group (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.90-1.11]). No differences were noted in mortality (15.3% vs 13.2%; adjusted RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.78-1.64]) or BPD among survivors to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (62.9% vs 63.0%; adjusted RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.87-1.12]). More infants who received budesonide&#x2009;+&#x2009;surfactant compared with surfactant alone had hyperglycemia (66.7% vs 49.8%; adjusted RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.17-1.51]). In this large multicenter trial, the combination of budesonide with surfactant did not reduce the risk of BPD or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in extremely preterm infants.

      "abstract_md": "A patent foramen ovale (PFO), an opening between the right and left atria during normal fetal development that fails to close after birth, is present in approximately 25% of all adults. Paradoxical embolism, a venous thromboembolism that travels to the systemic circulation typically through a PFO, accounts for about 5% of all strokes and 10% of strokes in younger patients. Approximately 50% of patients 60 years or younger with an embolic stroke of undetermined source (cryptogenic stroke) have a PFO, compared with 25% of the general population. The Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score incorporates clinical characteristics (age, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, cortical infarct on imaging) to predict the likelihood that embolic stroke of undetermined source was caused by a PFO. Among patients in the lowest RoPE score category (score &lt;3), PFO prevalence was similar to that in the general population (23%), while PFO prevalence was 77% in patients with a RoPE score of 9 or 10. The PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification system combines the RoPE score and anatomical criteria from echocardiography (large shunt, atrial septal aneurysm) to classify PFO as the \"probable,\" \"possible,\" or \"unlikely\" cause of otherwise cryptogenic stroke. PFO closure reduces recurrent ischemic stroke in patients 60 years or younger with cryptogenic stroke. In a pooled analysis of 6 trials (3740 patients), the annualized incidence of stroke over a median follow-up of 57 months was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) with PFO closure vs 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) with medical therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]). However, the benefits and harms of closure were highly heterogeneous across the trial populations. In patients categorized as PASCAL \"probable\" (ie, younger patients without vascular risk factors and high-risk PFO anatomical features), there was a 90% decreased relative rate of recurrent ischemic stroke after PFO closure at 2 years (hazard ratio, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.03-0.35]; absolute risk reduction, 2.1% [95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%]). PASCAL \"unlikely\" patients (eg, older patients with vascular risk factors and no high-risk PFO anatomical features) did not have a lower recurrent stroke rate with PFO closure but had higher risk of procedure- and device-related adverse events, such as atrial fibrillation. Patent foramen ovale is present in approximately 25% of all adults and is a common cause of stroke in young and middle-aged patients. The PASCAL classification system can help guide patient selection for PFO closure. Percutaneous PFO closure substantially reduces the risk of stroke recurrence in well-selected patients younger than 60 years after cryptogenic stroke."

      "abstract_md": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is linked to elevated cardiovascular risk, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD). A bivalent RSV prefusion F protein (RSVpreF) vaccine was recently approved for preventing RSV-related lower respiratory tract illness, but its effectiveness against cardiovascular outcomes has not been evaluated in a randomized trial. To investigate the vaccine effectiveness of RSVpreF compared with no vaccine against cardiovascular outcomes among adults aged 60 years or older. Prespecified secondary analysis of the DAN-RSV trial, a pragmatic, open-label, individually randomized clinical trial conducted in Denmark during the 2024-2025 winter season. The first participant was enrolled on November 18, 2024. Adults aged 60 years or older were eligible for inclusion regardless of comorbidity status. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive RSVpreF (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;65&#x202f;642) or no vaccine (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;65&#x202f;634). Hospitalization for any cardiorespiratory disease was a prespecified secondary outcome, and hospitalizations for any CVD, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation were prespecified exploratory outcomes. Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after booked study visit through May 31, 2025. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 - incidence rate ratio, expressed as a percentage. Of 131&#x202f;276 participants included (mean age, 69.4 [SD, 6.5] years; 50.3% male), 28&#x202f;662 (21.8%) had preexisting CVD. All-cause cardiorespiratory hospitalization incidence was lower in the RSVpreF group compared with the control group (26.3 vs 29.2 events per 1000 participant-years [PY]; absolute rate reduction, 2.90 [95% CI, 0.10-5.71] per 1000 PY; vaccine effectiveness, 9.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-18.7%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). There was no significant interaction by baseline CVD status (CVD at baseline: vaccine effectiveness, 5.0% [95% CI, -11.2% to 16.7%]; no CVD at baseline: vaccine effectiveness, 15.2% [95% CI, 2.2%-27.1%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.27 for interaction). For the RSVpreF group vs control group, respectively, incidence rates of all-cause cardiovascular hospitalization were 16.4 vs 17.7 events per 1000 PY (vaccine effectiveness, 7.4% [95% CI, -5.5% to 18.8%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.24), and incidence rates of stroke were 3.0 vs 3.8 events per 1000 PY (vaccine effectiveness, 19.4% [95% CI, -8.6% to 40.4%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.14). There were also no statistically significant between-group differences for myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, and atrial fibrillation. In adults aged 60 years or older, all-cause cardiorespiratory hospitalization was significantly lower with RSVpreF than with no vaccine. The findings suggest potential downstream cardiorespiratory benefits of RSV immunization, although the effect on all-cause cardiovascular hospitalization was not statistically significant.

One dose is recommended for all adults aged 75 years or older and those aged 60 to 74 years at increased risk of severe RSV; however, duration of protection is unknown. To evaluate RSV vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization among adults aged 60 years or older during 2 RSV seasons. A total of 6958 adults aged 60 years or older were included in this test-negative, case-control study if they were hospitalized with acute respiratory illness at any of 26 hospitals in 20 US states during the October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, or October 1, 2024, to April 30, 2025, RSV seasons and had respiratory virus testing within 10 days of illness onset. Case patients tested positive for RSV only; control patients tested negative for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through patient interview and electronic health records. Receipt of 1 RSV vaccine dose at least 14 days before illness onset. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the odds of RSV vaccination among hospitalized cases and controls. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, geographic region, and calendar month and year. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1&#x2009;-&#x2009;adjusted odds ratio)&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;100%. Analyses were stratified by timing of RSV vaccine receipt (same vs prior season) relative to illness onset. Of 6958 adults aged 60 years or older, 821 (11.8%) were RSV cases and 6137 (88.2%) were controls. A total of 1438 patients were Black (20.1%) and 4314 were White (62.0%); 3534 were female (50.8%). Median age was 72 years (IQR, 66-80 years) and 1829 adults (26.3%) were immunocompromised. A total of 63 cases (7.7%) and 966 controls (15.7%) were vaccinated. Estimated vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization was 58% (95% CI, 45%-68%) during 2 seasons and 69% (95% CI, 52%-81%) for same-season vaccination vs 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.06) for prior-season vaccination. Estimated vaccine effectiveness during 2 seasons was significantly lower among immunocompromised adults (30%; 95% CI, -9% to 55%) than immunocompetent adults (67%; 95% CI, 53%-77%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02) and among those with cardiovascular disease (56%; 95% CI, 32%-72%) vs without (80%; 95% CI, 62%-90%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03). Respiratory syncytial virus vaccines prevented RSV-associated hospitalization during 2 seasons, although effectiveness was lower in patients with immunocompromise and cardiovascular disease than in those without these conditions. Ongoing monitoring is needed to determine the optimal RSV revaccination interval."

To determine whether sodium bicarbonate infusion is associated with day 90 all-cause mortality in patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury. Randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted with 640 patients in 43 French intensive care units from October 6, 2019, to December 19, 2023, with 90-day follow-up. The last date of follow-up was June 17, 2024. Adults with severe metabolic acidemia (defined as pH &#x2264;7.20) and moderate to severe acute kidney injury were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion or no sodium bicarbonate to target an arterial pH of 7.30 or higher. The primary outcome was day 90 all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included day 28 and day 180 all-cause mortality; use of organ support therapy, vasopressors, or invasive mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit and hospital length of stay; intensive care unit-acquired infections; fluid balance; day-7 Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment score (6 organ systems' function is evaluated and scored from 0 [no dysfunction] to 4 [failure]; total score ranges from 0 [normal] to 24 [maximum failure]); and major adverse kidney events on day 90. Among 640 randomly assigned patients, 627 were analyzed (313 in the control group and 314 in the bicarbonate group). The median age was 67 years (IQR, 59-74 years); 194 of 314 patients (62%) in the bicarbonate group and 185 of 313 controls (59%) were male. In the primary analysis, day 90 all-cause mortality was 195 of 314 patients (62.1%) in the bicarbonate group and 193 of 313 (61.7%) in the control group (absolute difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -7.2 to 8.0; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.91). There was no evidence of a group effect on day 28 or day 180 all-cause mortality. Among 18 secondary outcomes, kidney replacement therapy was used in 109 of 314 (35%) bicarbonate group patients and 157 of 313 (50%) controls (absolute difference, -15.5; 95% CI, -23.1 to -7.8). No evidence of a group effect was found on other secondary outcomes, including adverse events. For patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury, intravenous sodium bicarbonate did not affect mortality. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04010630."

      "abstract_md": "The optimal strategy for hemodynamic resuscitation in early septic shock remains uncertain. To determine the effect of a personalized hemodynamic resuscitation protocol targeting capillary refill time (CRT-PHR) on a hierarchical composite outcome of mortality, duration of vital support, and length of hospital stay. This randomized clinical trial was conducted in 86 centers in 19 countries. Patients within the first 4 hours of septic shock were included between March 2022 and April 2025, with last follow-up in July 2025. Patients were randomized to undergo CRT-PHR (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;720), including assessment of pulse pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, fluid responsiveness, and bedside echocardiography, to tailor fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes, vs usual care (n = 747). The primary outcome was a hierarchical composite of mortality, duration of vital support (vasoactives, mechanical ventilation, and kidney replacement therapy), and length of hospital stay assessed at 28 days. A win ratio was calculated for the primary outcome by comparing all possible patient pairs, starting with the first event in the hierarchy and stratified by median APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score at admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, vital support-free days, and length of hospital stay at 28 days. From 1501 randomized patients, 1467 were included in the primary analysis (mean age, 66 [17] years; 43.3% female). There were 131&#x202f;131 wins (48.9%) in the CRT-PHR group vs 112&#x202f;787 (42.1%) in the usual care group for the hierarchical composite primary outcome, with a win ratio of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02-1.33; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). Individual wins for death were 19.1% vs 17.8%; duration of vital support, 26.4% vs 21.1%; and length of hospital stay, 3.4% vs 3.2% in the intervention vs usual care groups, respectively. Among patients with early septic shock, a personalized hemodynamic resuscitation protocol targeting capillary refill time was superior to usual care for the primary composite outcome, primarily due to a lower duration of vital support.

      "abstract_md": "Acute dysfunction of vital organs is the hallmark of critical illness. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the most widely adopted approach to describe organ dysfunction, has not been updated in 30 years and therefore may not appropriately capture current clinical practice and outcomes. To inform the data-driven component of an updated score (SOFA-2) in varied geographical and resource settings (stages 6-8) after expert input via a modified Delphi process (stages 1-5). A federated analysis was performed on data collected from adult patients admitted to 1319 intensive care units (ICUs) in 9 countries (Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Italy, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, United States) between 2014 and 2023. Four representative multicenter cohorts containing data from 2&#x202f;098&#x202f;356 patients were used for data-driven score development and internal validation. External validation was performed on 6 cohorts containing data from 1&#x202f;241&#x202f;114 patients. Content validity for organ dysfunction identified through the modified Delphi process should be reflected by predictive validity using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the score measured on the first ICU day (higher scores indicate worse organ dysfunction). Of 3.34 million patient encounters, 270&#x202f;108 (8.1%) died in the ICU (range, 4.5% to 20.5% across the 10 cohorts). SOFA-2 modified the 6 organ systems of the original SOFA score (brain, respiratory, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, hemostasis), including new variables and revised thresholds that better describe the organ dysfunction distribution from 0 to 4 points and their associated mortality (SOFA-2 AUROC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.81; SOFA-1 AUROC, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74-0.81). Evaluation of sequential SOFA-2 data from ICU day 1 to day 7 maintained its predictive validity. Insufficient data and lack of content validity precluded incorporation of gastrointestinal and immune dysfunction scores into SOFA-2. The SOFA-2 score, updated to include contemporary organ support treatments and new score thresholds, describes organ dysfunction in a large, geographically and socioeconomically diverse population of critically ill adults."

      "abstract_md": "Keratinocyte carcinomas are skin cancers that arise from keratinocytes and are composed of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs). Keratinocyte carcinomas are common in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Approximately 5.4 million keratinocyte carcinomas are diagnosed in the US annually. Keratinocyte carcinomas are primarily located on the head and neck (40%-64% of BCCs; 35%-45% of cSCCs). BCC typically presents as a pink, smooth, raised lesion or a pink to red, flat lesion. cSCC typically presents as a red, scaly, flat lesion (in situ tumors) or a red, firm, raised lesion with scale or erosion (invasive tumors). UV light exposure is the primary cause, and lighter skin pigmentation and skin phototype (eg, skin that more easily burns) are the primary risk factors. Other risk factors include older age, male sex, indoor tanning, history of precancerous lesions (actinic keratoses), history of keratinocyte carcinomas, and immunosuppression (eg, organ transplant). In-office surgical excision or curettage and electrodessication (in which the tumor is scraped away using a curette and the wound base is cauterized) is typically performed by a dermatologist for keratinocyte carcinomas with lower risk of recurrence, including those that are nonrecurrent and have well-defined borders, small size, and location on the trunk and extremities. After surgical excision, approximately 3% of BCCs and 5% of cSCCs recur; after curettage and electrodessication, approximately 6% of BCCs and 2% of cSCCs recur. For keratinocyte carcinomas at higher risk of recurrence, in-office Mohs surgery (a technique in which a dermatologist with specialized training removes the tumor in stages and evaluates the entire surgical margin pathologically using a microscope after each stage to ensure complete tumor excision) is typically used. After Mohs surgery, approximately 4% of BCCs and 3% of cSCCs recur. Patients diagnosed with keratinocyte carcinoma are at high risk of additional keratinocyte carcinomas (approximately 40% within 5 years). Evidence-based prevention of keratinocyte carcinoma involves use of sunscreen. In a randomized clinical trial, use of daily sunscreen decreased cSCC risk (rate ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-0.99; 1587 cSCCs per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in controls vs 953 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years in sunscreen group). Keratinocyte carcinoma, composed of BCC and cSCC, is the most common cancer in the US, with an estimated 5.4 million diagnoses annually. Most keratinocyte carcinomas are effectively treated with in-office surgical procedures. Patients with keratinocyte carcinoma are recommended to undergo a skin examination at least annually due to their high risk of developing additional skin cancers."
