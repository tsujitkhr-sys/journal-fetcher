      "abstract_md": "Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease affecting over 1 billion people worldwide, driving substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Glucagon-like peptide-1 therapies (GLP-1 therapies) provide clinically meaningful weight loss and broad metabolic benefits. In response to Member State requests, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for adults living with obesity. The guidelines recognize obesity as a chronic, relapsing disease requiring lifelong care and emphasize early diagnosis and integrated, person-centered approaches combining behavioral, medical, surgical, and other interventions alongside prevention and management of comorbidities. WHO recommends long-term GLP-1 therapies combined with intensive behavioral therapy to maximize and sustain benefits. Both recommendations were graded conditional, reflecting that GLP-1 therapies-with or without behavioral therapy-are effective, but limited long-term data, cost, system readiness, equity, variability in patient priorities, and context-specific feasibility remain considerations. Implementation of these guidelines depends on equitable access to affordable therapies, health system preparedness, and most importantly assurance that care is person-centered, nondiscriminatory, and universally accessible. Given the time required to implement these measures, a priority is a transparent, equitable, evidence-based framework to identify those at highest need while allowing incremental expansion of eligibility as access, capacity, and readiness evolve; this will be the next focus of the WHO guideline. Medication alone cannot solve the global obesity burden. The availability of GLP-1 therapies should galvanize the global community to build a fair, integrated, and sustainable obesity ecosystem. Countries must ensure equitable access not only to comprehensive disease management, but also to health promotion and prevention policies and interventions targeting the general population and those at high risk."

      "abstract_md": "Levosimendan may facilitate weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and improve survival, but supporting evidence remains limited. To assess whether early administration of levosimendan reduces the time to successful VA-ECMO weaning in patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 11 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. Between August 27, 2021, and September 10, 2024, 205 adult patients with acute cardiogenic shock who had started VA-ECMO in the preceding 48 hours were enrolled. Final follow-up was completed on November 10, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan, 0.15 &#x3bc;g/kg per minute, to be increased to 0.20 &#x3bc;g/kg per minute after 2 hours (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;101), or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;104). The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO-, mechanical ventilation-, and organ failure-free days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, serious adverse events, and all-cause 30- and 60-day mortality. Among the 205 randomized patients (median age, 58 [IQR, 50-67] years; 149 [72.7%] male), main cardiogenic shock etiologies were postcardiotomy (79 [38.5%]), acute myocardial infarction (56 [27.3%]), and myocarditis (28 [13.7%]). Treatment dose was increased to 0.20 &#xb1; 0.01 &#x3bc;g/kg per minute in 93% of patients receiving levosimendan and in 96% of those receiving placebo. Within 30 days, 69 of 101 patients (68.3%) had a successful ECMO weaning in the levosimendan group compared with 71 of 104 (68.3%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -12.8% to 12.7%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.39]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.92). In the levosimendan and placebo groups, respectively, median ECMO duration (5 [IQR, 4-7] days vs 6 [IQR, 4-11] days; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.53), mean ICU length of stay (18 [SD, 15] days vs 19 [SD, 15] days; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.42), and 60-day mortality (27.7% vs 25.0%; risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -9.0% to 15.3%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.78) did not differ significantly. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently with levosimendan (18 [17.8%] vs 9 [8.7%]; absolute risk difference, 9.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-18.1%]). Among patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock supported by VA-ECMO, early levosimendan administration did not significantly reduce the time to successful weaning of ECMO compared with placebo.

To evaluate the prevalence of a discordance between cystatin C-based eGFR (eGFRcys) and creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr), identify characteristics associated with greater discordance, and evaluate associations of discordance with adverse outcomes. Participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC). Participants with concurrent cystatin C and creatinine measurements and clinical outcome measurement. Between April 2024 and August 2025, data were synthesized using individual-level meta-analysis. The primary independent measurement was a large negative eGFR difference (eGFRdiff), defined as an eGFRcys that was at least 30% lower than eGFRcr. Secondary (dependent) outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney failure with replacement therapy. A total of 821&#x202f;327 individuals from 23 outpatient cohorts (mean [SD] age, 59 [12] years; 48% female; 13.5% with diabetes; 40% with hypertension) and 39&#x202f;639 individuals from 2 inpatient cohorts (mean [SD] age, 67 [16] years; 31% female; 30% with diabetes; 72% with hypertension) were included. Among outpatient participants, 11% had a large negative eGFRdiff (range, 3%-50%). Among inpatients, 35% had a large negative eGFRdiff. Among outpatient participants, at a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (4) years, a large negative eGFRdiff, compared with an eGFRdiff between -30% and 30%, was associated with higher rates of all-cause mortality (28.4 vs 16.8 per 1000 person-years [PY]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.69 [95% CI, 1.57-1.82]), cardiovascular mortality (6.1 vs 3.8 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.48-1.76]), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (13.3 vs 9.8 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.27-1.44]), heart failure (13.2 vs 8.6 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.40-1.68]), and kidney failure with replacement therapy (2.7 vs 2.1 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.13-1.47]). In the CKD-PC, 11% of outpatient participants and 35% of hospitalized patients had an eGFRcys that was at least 30% lower than their eGFRcr. In the outpatient setting, presence of eGFRcys at least 30% lower than eGFRcr was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and kidney failure."

To evaluate whether individualized vs routine perioperative blood pressure management during major abdominal surgery improves clinical outcomes in patients considered at high risk of postoperative complications. This randomized single-blind clinical trial enrolled patients 45 years or older undergoing elective major abdominal surgery with general anesthesia expected to last 90 minutes or longer who had at least 1 additional high-risk criterion between February 26, 2023, and April 25, 2024, at 15 German university hospitals. The date of last follow-up was July 25, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to individualized perioperative blood pressure management (with mean arterial pressure [MAP] targets based on preoperative mean nighttime MAP assessed using automated blood pressure monitoring) or routine blood pressure management with a MAP target of 65 mm Hg or higher. The primary outcome was the incidence of a composite outcome of acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within the first 7 postoperative days. There were 22 secondary outcomes, including infectious complications within the first 7 postoperative days and a composite outcome of need for kidney replacement therapy, myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within 90 days after surgery. Of the 1272 patients enrolled, 1142 were randomized (571 patients to each group), and 1134 were included in the primary analysis (median age, 66 years [IQR, 59-73 years]; 34.1% female). The primary outcome occurred in 190 of 567 patients (33.5%) assigned to individualized blood pressure management and 173 of 567 patients (30.5%) assigned to routine blood pressure management (relative risk, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.93-1.30]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.31). None of the 22 secondary outcomes were significantly different, including infectious complications within the first 7 postoperative days (90/567 [15.9%] vs 97/567 [17.1%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.63) and a composite outcome of need for kidney replacement therapy, myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within 90 days after surgery (32/566 [5.7%] vs 20/567 [3.5%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.12). Among patients at high risk of postoperative complications undergoing major abdominal surgery, individualized perioperative blood pressure management with MAP targets based on preoperative mean nighttime MAP did not decrease the composite outcome of acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death within the first 7 postoperative days compared with routine blood pressure management with a MAP target of 65 mm Hg or higher.

To determine whether intraoperative blood pressure management stratified by risk of hypotension reduces postoperative functional disability compared with usual care in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery. In this randomized clinical trial, adults undergoing elective noncardiac surgery at 2 tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands were enrolled from June 17, 2021, to February 7, 2024. The date of last follow-up was October 24, 2024. Patients were randomized 1:1 to proactive blood pressure management with mean arterial pressure targets based on risk of intraoperative hypotension (low risk, &#x2265;70 mm Hg; intermediate risk, &#x2265;80; high risk, &#x2265;90) or usual management at their anesthesiologist's discretion, generally aiming to avoid a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg without higher predefined targets. The primary outcome was functional disability at 6 months, assessed with the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0; scale range, 0-100; higher scores indicate more disability). A minimally clinically important difference of 5 points was prespecified. There were 23 secondary outcomes, including quality of life, complications, and mortality within 6 months. The trial was stopped early for futility after 3247 of 5000 planned patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 44-69]; 1738 female [53.5%]) were enrolled. A total of 677 patients (21%) were low risk; 1814 (56%), intermediate risk, and 756 (23%), high risk. Baseline median WHODAS scores were 12.5 [IQR, 4.2-29.2] in proactive group and 14.6 [IQR, 4.2-29.2] in standard group). At 6 months, mean (SD) WHODAS scores were 17.7 (20.1) in the proactive group and 18.2 (20.5) in the standard group (mean difference, -0.5; 95% credible interval, -1.9 to 0.9). There were no significant differences in any of the 23 secondary outcomes. Intraoperative blood pressure management with mean arterial pressure goals stratified by risk of hypotension did not improve functional disability at 6 months postoperatively compared with standard intraoperative blood pressure management.

      "abstract_md": "Syphilis is an infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum, a gram-negative, spirochete bacterium. Worldwide, an estimated 8 million adults aged 18 to 49 years acquired syphilis in 2022. From 2019 to 2023, US syphilis cases increased by 61% overall, with diagnoses among females increasing by 112% and congenital syphilis cases increasing by 106%. Syphilis is transmitted via contact with infectious lesions during vaginal, anal, or oral sex or via the placenta during pregnancy. Individuals at increased risk for syphilis include people with HIV, those engaging in condomless sex with multiple partners, and men who have sex with men (MSM)-who comprised one-third (32.7%) of all males with primary and secondary syphilis in 2023. Early syphilis is defined as syphilis in the first year after infection and includes symptomatic (primary and secondary) and asymptomatic (early latent) stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by painless anogenital lesions. Secondary syphilis is associated with a diffuse rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Syphilis diagnosed more than a year after infection is referred to as late syphilis and includes asymptomatic (late latent) and symptomatic (tertiary) stages. Neurosyphilis, which can occur at any stage, can lead to meningitis, uveitis, hearing loss, or stroke. In pregnancy, up to 40% of fetuses with in-utero exposure to syphilis are stillborn or die from their infection during infancy. The diagnosis of syphilis relies on serologic reactivity along with a clinical history and presentation consistent with active or latent syphilis infection. The recommended treatment for syphilis is benzathine penicillin G administered as intramuscular doses of 2.4 million units: a single injection for early stage and 3 weekly injections for late latent stage syphilis. Strategies to identify and prevent syphilis infections include (1) screening of sexually active people aged 15 to 44 years at least once and at least annually for those at increased risk, (2) screening 3 times in pregnant individuals (at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester, and at delivery), (3) counseling about condom use, and (4) offering doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (200-mg doxycycline taken within 72 hours after sex as postexposure prophylaxis) to MSM and transgender women with a history of a sexually transmitted infection in the past year. Syphilis infections, including congenital syphilis, have increased in the US and worldwide over the past decade. First-line treatment for syphilis is benzathine penicillin G. Routine syphilis screening of all pregnant patients and all sexually active people aged 15 to 44 years and use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis in individuals at risk for syphilis infection are recommended strategies to decrease syphilis transmission."

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction due to Chagas disease. From December 10, 2019, through September 13, 2023, patients with HF, confirmed diagnosis of Chagas disease, left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 600 pg/mL or greater (or B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] &#x2265;150 pg/mL) or 400 pg/mL or greater (or BNP &#x2265;100 pg/mL) if hospitalized for HF within the previous 12 months were screened at 83 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Statistical analysis was conducted between May and July 2025. Patients were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan (target dose, 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (target dose, 10 mg twice daily), in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point was a hierarchical composite outcome tested, in order, of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for HF, or relative change in NT-proBNP from baseline to 12 weeks. The primary analysis was done using a win ratio approach. Overall, 462 participants were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan and 460 to receive enalapril (mean [SD] age, 64.2 [10.8] years; 387 [42.0%] were female). Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 25.2 (18.4-33.2) months, cardiovascular death occurred in 110 patients (23.8% [18.3% wins in the hierarchical comparison]) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 117 patients (25.4% [17.5% wins]) in the enalapril group. A total of 102 patients (22.1% [7.7% wins]) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 111 (24.1% [6.9% wins]) in the enalapril group experienced a first hospitalization for HF. Patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group had a median (IQR) decrease in NT-proBNP of 30.6% (-54.3% to -0.9%) at 12 weeks, leading to 22.5% wins, while those in the enalapril group had a 5.5% (-31.9% to 37.5%) decrease (7.2% wins). The resulting stratified win ratio was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.28-1.82; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) for sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril. In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction due to Chagas disease, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril, but there was a greater reduction in NT-proBNP at 12 weeks in patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group.

To compare driving pressure-guided high PEEP and recruitment maneuvers with standard low PEEP without recruitment maneuvers with respect to postoperative pulmonary complications. Randomized clinical trial of 1435 adults at increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications who were scheduled for open abdominal surgery. The trial was conducted at 29 sites in 5 countries across Europe from April 2019 to December 2024; final follow-up was in March 2025. Statistical analysis was conducted in May 2025. Patients were randomized to undergo intraoperative ventilation with driving pressure-guided high PEEP and recruitment maneuvers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;718) or to intraoperative ventilation with standard low PEEP (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;717). All patients received low tidal volume ventilation. The primary outcome was a composite of pulmonary complications within the first 5 postoperative days, including severe respiratory failure, bronchospasm, suspected pulmonary infection, pulmonary infiltrates, aspiration pneumonitis, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pleural effusion, cardiopulmonary edema, and pneumothorax. Among the 16 prespecified secondary outcomes, 4 concerned intraoperative complications, including hypotension (decrease in mean arterial pressure of &gt;20% for &gt;3 minutes) and desaturation (Spo2 &lt;92% for &gt;1 minute). Among 1468 adults, 1435 (98%) completed the trial (median [IQR] age, 66 [57-74] years; 52% female). In the primary analysis population, the primary outcome occurred in 142 of 718 patients (19.8%) in the driving pressure-guided high PEEP group compared with 125 of 717 patients (17.4%) in the low PEEP group (absolute difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -1.5% to 6.4%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.23). The incidence of hypotension (382 [54.0%] vs 317 [45.0%]) and use of vasoactive agents (224 [32.0%] vs 130 [18.8%]) was higher in the high PEEP group; the incidence of intraoperative desaturation (6 [0.8%] vs 20 [2.8%]) was higher in the low PEEP group. Among patients at increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications undergoing open abdominal surgery under general anesthesia, intraoperative ventilation with driving pressure-guided high PEEP and recruitment maneuvers, compared with a strategy with standard low PEEP, did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.

Most international guidelines recommend routine lumbar punctures for all febrile infants 28 days or younger to rule out bacterial meningitis. Clinical prediction rules may allow for select testing, but limited information exists on their performance to identify infants at low risk for invasive bacterial infections. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the updated Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) prediction rule for identifying febrile infants 28 days or younger with bacteremia or bacterial meningitis. This pooled analysis of 4 published prospective cohort studies from pediatric emergency departments across 6 countries within the global Pediatric Emergency Research Network included previously healthy, non-ill-appearing, full-term (&#x2265;37 weeks' gestation) infants aged 28 days or younger with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 &#xb0;C who underwent urine, blood, and serum testing. Infants were classified as low risk if they had a negative urinalysis/dipstick test result, serum procalcitonin less than or equal to 0.5 ng/mL, and blood absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 4000/mm3. Meta-analytic methods were applied to assess diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) of the PECARN rule for detection of infants with invasive bacterial infections (bacteremia or bacterial meningitis). Among 1537 infants 28 days or younger (905 male, 1324 hospitalized, 1080 with lumbar punctures), 69 (4.5%) had invasive bacterial infections, including 11 (0.7%) with bacterial meningitis. Overall, 632 (41.1%) met low-risk criteria. The prediction rule had a sensitivity of 94.2% (95% CI, 85.6%-97.8%), specificity of 41.6% (95% CI, 36.7%-46.7%), positive predictive value of 6.9% (95% CI, 4.8%-9.9%), and negative predictive value of 99.4% (95% CI, 98.1%-99.8%) for invasive bacterial infections. In a secondary analysis of 2531 infants from the 2 US-based cohorts from which the rule was originally derived and the 4 validation cohorts, 96 (3.8%) had invasive bacterial infections, 22 (0.9%) had bacterial meningitis, and 1079 (42.6%) were classified as low risk; rule performance was similar. No infants with bacterial meningitis were misclassified in the primary or secondary analyses. The updated PECARN rule had high sensitivity but lower specificity for identifying febrile infants 28 days or younger with invasive bacterial infections in this study, with no missed cases of bacterial meningitis. These results may support shared decision-making regarding select vs routine use of lumbar puncture among infants classified as being at low risk of invasive bacterial infections."

      "abstract_md": "Automated closed-loop ventilation systems continuously adjust ventilator settings based on real-time physiologic feedback and may optimize lung-protective ventilation. Their effect on patient-centered outcomes in critically ill patients receiving ventilation remains uncertain. To determine whether early initiation of automated closed-loop ventilation increases ventilator-free days at day 28 compared with protocolized conventional ventilation. International, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted at 7 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Adult patients with less than 1 hour elapsed after initiation of invasive ventilation and expected to require ventilation for 24 hours or longer were enrolled between October 2020 and June 2025, with final follow-up completed at 90 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive automated closed-loop ventilation using INTELLiVENT adaptive support ventilation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;602) or protocolized conventional ventilation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;599). Both groups followed standardized ventilation management, sedation, and weaning protocols. The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, defined as days alive and free from invasive ventilation. Secondary outcomes included mortality, duration of ventilation among survivors, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and ventilation quality. Safety outcomes included severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and need for rescue therapies, including prone positioning, recruitment maneuvers, or bronchoscopy. Among 1514 randomized patients, 1201 (79%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (36% women; median age, 63 years). The median of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 16.7 days (IQR, 0.0-26.1 days) in the closed-loop ventilation group and 16.3 days (IQR, 0.0-26.5 days) in the conventional ventilation group (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.06; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.23). There were no differences between groups in components of the primary outcome, ie, duration of ventilation in survivors and 28-day mortality. There were no differences in secondary outcomes except for ventilation quality, which was higher with closed-loop ventilation. Severe hypercapnia and hypoxemia were less frequent in the closed-loop group, and fewer patients required rescue therapies, primarily prone positioning, compared with the conventional group (non-statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment). Among critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, early use of an automated closed-loop ventilation system did not increase ventilator-free days at day 28 compared with protocolized conventional ventilation.

To investigate whether precision immunotherapy guided by the presence of macrophage activation-like syndrome or sepsis-induced immunoparalysis improves organ dysfunction by day 9. A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 6 countries. Patients with sepsis, defined by Sepsis-3, were included if they had community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia or bacteremia and sepsis and had displayed either macrophage activation-like syndrome (blood ferritin &gt;4420 ng/mL) or sepsis-induced immunoparalysis (blood ferritin &#x2264;4420 ng/mL and &lt;5000 human leukocyte antigen DR receptors on CD45/CD14 monocytes). The first patient was enrolled August 5, 2021, and the last follow-up, April 29, 2024. Eligible patients were randomized to receive standard care and precision immunotherapy or standard care and placebo. Those in the precision immunotherapy group with macrophage activation-like syndrome received anakinra intravenously (IV) and placebo subcutaneously, and those with sepsis-induced immunoparalysis received subcutaneous recombinant human interferon gamma and IV placebo. Those in the placebo group received both IV and subcutaneous placebo. Treatment was administered for up to 15 days. The primary end point was a decrease of at least 1.4 points in the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from baseline by day 9. The SOFA score evaluates 6 organ systems, ranging from 0, no dysfunction, to 4, failure, and the total score ranges from 0, normal, to 24, most severe form of multiorgan failure. Key secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality. Of 672 patients assessed for eligibility, 281 were randomized and 276 were included in the primary analysis population (mean [SD] age, 70 [13] years; 93 females [33.7%]; median baseline SOFA score, 9 [IQR, 7-11]). The SOFA decrease end point was attained by 46 of 131 patients (35.1%) in the precision immunotherapy group and by 26 of 145 patients (17.9%) in the placebo group (difference, 17.2% [95% CI, 6.8% to 27.2%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002). Mortality at 28 days was not statistically significantly different between groups. A total of 1069 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (88.8%) were reported; increased incidence of anemia was noted in the anakinra group; and hemorrhage in the recombinant human interferon gamma group. Among patients with sepsis, precision immunotherapy targeting macrophage activation-like syndrome and sepsis-induced immunoparalysis improved organ dysfunction by day 9 compared with placebo.

To assess the effectiveness and safety of dimethyl sulfoxide-cryopreserved platelets, which have a shelf-life of 2 years, as a treatment for cardiac surgery bleeding. The Cryopreserved vs Liquid Platelets II (CLIP-II) trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group noninferiority trial, which enrolled patients between August 2021 and April 2024 at 11 Australian tertiary hospitals, with follow-up completed in July 2024. Patients at high risk of platelet transfusion were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, were coagulopathic, or were females aged 18 to 55 years who were rhesus D (RhD) negative or of unknown RhD status. Of 879 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 182 were excluded and 285 did not consent, leaving 412. Of these, 388 were randomized and 202 received study platelets. Patients received up to 3 units of either group O cryopreserved platelets or conventional liquid-stored platelets, commencing intraoperatively or in the first 24 postoperative hours. The primary outcome was postsurgical chest drain bleeding within the first 24 hours following intensive care unit admission. Noninferiority was defined prospectively as less than 20% greater bleeding in this period. Five secondary and 42 tertiary outcomes were defined a priori. Of the 202 transfused patients (mean [SD] age, 64.4 [13] years; 75.7% male), 61 (30.2%) underwent nonelective surgery. The primary outcome did not differ between groups (605 mL in cryopreserved platelet group vs 535 mL in liquid-stored platelet group; ratio of geometric means [cryopreserved to liquid ratio], 1.13 [95% CI, 0.96-1.34]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.07). As the confidence interval includes bleeding exceeding the noninferiority margin, noninferiority was not established. Cryopreserved platelet transfusion was associated with higher intraoperative and total perioperative blood loss (ratio of geometric means [cryopreserved to liquid ratio], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.12-1.80]; 1.31 [95% CI, 1.07-1.60], respectively), and increased red cell, plasma, and cryoprecipitate transfusion. While there were no differences in the incidence of prespecified adverse events, patients receiving cryopreserved platelets experienced longer times to extubation and intensive care unit/hospital discharge (median [IQR] duration of ventilation, 25.5 hours [16.1-77.3] vs 23.6 hours [13.1-52.8]; median [IQR] intensive care unit length of stay, 3.8 days [2.0-6.0] vs 3.0 days [1.9-4.9]; median hospital length of stay, 10.9 days [7.87-17.0] vs 9.1 [6.9-14.9]). Cryopreserved platelets did not meet the predefined threshold for noninferiority in hemostatic effectiveness at 24 hours after ICU admission. Additional predefined end points consistently indicated diminished hemostatic effectiveness, although prespecified adverse events were comparable. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03991481."

To determine whether sodium bicarbonate infusion is associated with day 90 all-cause mortality in patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury. Randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted with 640 patients in 43 French intensive care units from October 6, 2019, to December 19, 2023, with 90-day follow-up. The last date of follow-up was June 17, 2024. Adults with severe metabolic acidemia (defined as pH &#x2264;7.20) and moderate to severe acute kidney injury were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion or no sodium bicarbonate to target an arterial pH of 7.30 or higher. The primary outcome was day 90 all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included day 28 and day 180 all-cause mortality; use of organ support therapy, vasopressors, or invasive mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit and hospital length of stay; intensive care unit-acquired infections; fluid balance; day-7 Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment score (6 organ systems' function is evaluated and scored from 0 [no dysfunction] to 4 [failure]; total score ranges from 0 [normal] to 24 [maximum failure]); and major adverse kidney events on day 90. Among 640 randomly assigned patients, 627 were analyzed (313 in the control group and 314 in the bicarbonate group). The median age was 67 years (IQR, 59-74 years); 194 of 314 patients (62%) in the bicarbonate group and 185 of 313 controls (59%) were male. In the primary analysis, day 90 all-cause mortality was 195 of 314 patients (62.1%) in the bicarbonate group and 193 of 313 (61.7%) in the control group (absolute difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -7.2 to 8.0; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.91). There was no evidence of a group effect on day 28 or day 180 all-cause mortality. Among 18 secondary outcomes, kidney replacement therapy was used in 109 of 314 (35%) bicarbonate group patients and 157 of 313 (50%) controls (absolute difference, -15.5; 95% CI, -23.1 to -7.8). No evidence of a group effect was found on other secondary outcomes, including adverse events. For patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury, intravenous sodium bicarbonate did not affect mortality. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04010630."

      "abstract_md": "Superficial vein thrombosis (SuVT) is characterized by thrombus in the superficial veins, typically in the lower or upper extremities, and has an estimated annual incidence of 64 to 131 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years. Approximately 10% of patients with SuVT progress to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Endothelial injury (caused by infection or intravenous devices), venous stasis (such as from chronic venous insufficiency or prolonged immobility), and hypercoagulability (due to cancer or pregnancy) are pathophysiologic factors associated with SuVT. Clinical risk factors for lower extremity SuVT are similar to those of DVT and PE and include pregnancy, varicose veins, and active cancer. The incidence of SuVT is greater in females than males (78-167 compared with 49-116 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years). In contrast with lower extremity SuVT, upper extremity SuVT is primarily caused by indwelling intravenous catheters. Patients typically present with a tender, red, palpable cord under the skin in the upper or lower extremity. D-dimer testing has a sensitivity of approximately 48% to 74.3% and, therefore, is not reliable for excluding SuVT. Approximately 25% of patients with lower extremity SuVT present with concomitant DVT, likely because risk factors for SuVT and DVT are similar and because SuVT can extend into deep veins. In people without classic symptoms and signs of SuVT, ultrasonography can establish the presence and extent of the thrombus. Management may include elastic compression stockings and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For patients with SuVTs that are at least 5 cm long or those with persistent or worsening symptoms despite several days of conservative therapy, treatment includes anticoagulation with fondaparinux 2.5 mg. Alternative anticoagulation treatment includes rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily and low-molecular-weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg once daily), which may reduce subsequent venous thromboembolic events. SuVT located within 3 cm of a deep vein should be treated with therapeutic doses of anticoagulation such as direct oral anticoagulants. SuVT typically presents as a tender, painful, palpable cord under the skin. Management may include elastic compression stockings, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and systemic anticoagulation with fondaparinux 2.5 mg or rivaroxaban 10 mg. SuVTs within 3 cm of a deep vein should be treated with therapeutic dose anticoagulation."

To determine whether expectant management compared with active treatment of a protocol-defined PDA in preterm infants decreases the incidence of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). A randomized clinical trial including infants born at 22 to 28 weeks' gestation and diagnosed with a protocol-defined PDA between the age of 48 hours and 21 days at screening. The trial was conducted from December 2018 to December 2024 at 33 hospitals within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. The final date of follow-up was June 2025. Infants with PDA were randomized to expectant management (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;242) or active treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;240; acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or indomethacin) to close the PDA. The primary outcome was death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. The secondary outcomes included the components of the primary outcome and other morbidities of prematurity. A total of 482 infants were randomized (median gestational age, 25 weeks [IQR, 24 to 27 weeks]; median birth weight, 760 g [IQR, 620 to 935 g]). The trial was stopped for futility and safety after the 50% interim analysis for the primary outcome due to higher survival in the expectant management group. The incidence of death or BPD was 80.9% (195/241) of infants in the expectant management group vs 79.6% (191/240) of infants in the active treatment group (adjusted risk difference, 1.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 8.1%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.73). The incidence of death before 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was 4.1% (10/241) of infants in the expectant management group vs 9.6% (23/240) of infants in the active treatment group (adjusted risk difference, -5.6% [95% CI, -10.1% to -1.2%]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). Infections resulting in death occurred in 0.8% (2/241) of infants in the expectant management group vs 3.8% (9/240) of infants in the active treatment group. In extremely preterm infants with a protocol-defined PDA, death or BPD did not differ between the expectant management group and the active treatment group. Survival was substantially higher with expectant management. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03456336."

To determine the effect of a personalized hemodynamic resuscitation protocol targeting capillary refill time (CRT-PHR) on a hierarchical composite outcome of mortality, duration of vital support, and length of hospital stay. This randomized clinical trial was conducted in 86 centers in 19 countries. Patients within the first 4 hours of septic shock were included between March 2022 and April 2025, with last follow-up in July 2025. Patients were randomized to undergo CRT-PHR (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;720), including assessment of pulse pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, fluid responsiveness, and bedside echocardiography, to tailor fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes, vs usual care (n = 747). The primary outcome was a hierarchical composite of mortality, duration of vital support (vasoactives, mechanical ventilation, and kidney replacement therapy), and length of hospital stay assessed at 28 days. A win ratio was calculated for the primary outcome by comparing all possible patient pairs, starting with the first event in the hierarchy and stratified by median APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score at admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, vital support-free days, and length of hospital stay at 28 days. From 1501 randomized patients, 1467 were included in the primary analysis (mean age, 66 [17] years; 43.3% female). There were 131&#x202f;131 wins (48.9%) in the CRT-PHR group vs 112&#x202f;787 (42.1%) in the usual care group for the hierarchical composite primary outcome, with a win ratio of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02-1.33; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). Individual wins for death were 19.1% vs 17.8%; duration of vital support, 26.4% vs 21.1%; and length of hospital stay, 3.4% vs 3.2% in the intervention vs usual care groups, respectively. Among patients with early septic shock, a personalized hemodynamic resuscitation protocol targeting capillary refill time was superior to usual care for the primary composite outcome, primarily due to a lower duration of vital support.

To evaluate the effects of rituximab for patients with FRNS or SDNS. Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 13 centers in Japan. Adults with FRNS or SDNS who had urine protein of less than 0.3 g/gCr were enrolled between September 1, 2020, and June 28, 2022. Final follow-up occurred on March 15, 2024. Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous rituximab, 375 mg/m2 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36), or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36) at weeks 1, 2, and 25. Patients were followed up for 49 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were free of relapse of nephrotic syndrome at 49-week follow-up. Relapse was defined as urine protein of at least 1 g/gCr on 2 consecutive measurements. Among 72 randomized participants (mean age, 47.9 years; 56.1% female), 66 (92%) received the study drug at least once and were included in analyses. The relapse-free rate at week 49 was 87.4% (95% CI, 69.8%-95.1%) in the rituximab group and 38.0% (95% CI, 22.1%-53.8%) in the placebo group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001 by 1-sided log-rank test). One of 18 secondary outcomes was statistically significant (favoring rituximab). The median relapse-free time in the rituximab group was greater than 49.0 weeks and in the placebo group was 30.8 weeks. A stratified Cox model showed a hazard ratio for relapse of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.05-0.46; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) in the rituximab group compared with the placebo group. The most common adverse effect was infusion reaction (13 [40.6%] in the rituximab group and 1 [2.9%] in the placebo group). These results support use of rituximab to prevent relapse in adults with FRNS or SDNS.

      "abstract_md": "The most effective initial fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) for resuscitating preterm newborns is unknown. To compare outcomes of newborns born at 23 to 28 weeks' gestation resuscitated with initial Fio2 of 0.6 vs 0.3. Randomized clinical trial conducted in 31 maternity hospitals in 6 countries. Consent by waiver was obtained in Australia, certain institutions in India, and Malaysia; prospective informed consent was obtained in certain institutions in India and all institutions in Singapore, Spain, and the US. Infants due at 23 to 28 weeks' gestation were randomized shortly before birth. Those with congenital abnormalities affecting oxygenation, neurodevelopment, or survival were excluded. Randomization was conducted from September 2018 to September 2024, with follow-up expected to close in September 2026. Infants were randomized (1:1) to receive an initial Fio2 of 0.6 or 0.3; Fio2 was titrated to meet standard targets for oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry in the first 10 minutes or for clinical needs. Clinicians and those assessing outcomes were not blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was death and brain injury at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age; secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome. A total of 1641 newborns were randomized. The primary analysis included 728 newborns randomized to receive an Fio2 of 0.6 and 741 to an Fio2 of 0.3 after excluding 172 newborns, mostly for birth after 28 weeks' gestation and transfer to another hospital before birth (54% female). Rates of escalation to Fio2 of 1.0 were similar between the groups (Fio2 of 0.6: 41%; Fio2 of 0.3: 38%). Primary outcome information was ascertained in 1423 newborns (96.9%). Death or brain injury at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age occurred in 330 of 703 newborns (46.9%) assigned to the Fio2 of 0.6 group vs 344 of 720 (47.8%) assigned to the Fio2 of 0.3 group (relative risk, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.89-1.09]). Initiating resuscitation of preterm infants with Fio2 of 0.6 vs 0.3 did not affect the risk of death or brain injury by 36 weeks' corrected gestational age. These results lay a foundation for future trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of using higher initial Fio2 levels for preterm infant resuscitation. ANZCTR Identifier: ACTRN12618000879268."

      "abstract_md": "Individual breast cancer risk can guide screening initiation, frequency, use of supplemental imaging, and preventive measures to improve breast cancer screening by shifting resources from low-risk women to high-risk women. To determine whether risk-based breast cancer screening is a feasible alternative to annual mammography. Parallel-group, pragmatic, multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing risk-based (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14&#x202f;212) with annual (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14&#x202f;160) breast cancer screening. Women aged 40 to 74 years without prior diagnoses of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, were recruited from all 50 US states from September 2016 to February 2023, with follow-up through September 5, 2025 (median follow-up, 5.1 years). Statistical analysis was conducted between July and November 2025. All study procedures were conducted via an online platform. Women who declined randomization were enrolled in an observational cohort. Risk assessment included sequencing of 9 susceptibility genes, polygenic risk score, and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium version 2 model. The risk-based group received 1 of 4 recommendations: (1) highest risk (&#x2265;6% 5-year risk, high-penetrance pathogenic variant): alternating mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 6 months and counseling; (2) elevated risk (top 2.5 risk percentile by age): annual mammography and risk-reduction counseling; (3) average risk: biennial mammography; and (4) low risk (aged 40-49 years and &lt;1.3% 5-year risk): no screening until risk is 1.3% or greater or age 50 years. The coprimary outcomes included noninferiority for stage &#x2265;IIB cancers and superiority in reducing biopsy rates. Secondary outcomes included identification of stage &#x2265;IIA cancers, mammogram rates, uptake of prevention strategies in higher risk cohorts, preference for screening group in the observational cohort, ductal carcinoma in situ, MRI, and stage-specific cancer rates. A total of 28&#x202f;372 women were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 54 (9.6) years and the majority were non-Hispanic White (77%). The rate of stage &#x2265;IIB cancers was noninferior in the risk-based compared with the annual group (risk-based: 30.0 [95% CI, 16.3-43.8] vs annual: 48.0 [95% CI, 30.1-65.5] per 100&#x202f;000 person-years; rate difference, -18.0 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years [95% CI, -40.2 to 4.1]). The rate of breast biopsies was not lower in the risk-based group (rate difference, 98.7 per 100&#x202f;000 person-years [95% CI, -17.9 to 215.3]) despite fewer mammograms (rate difference, -3835.9 [95% CI, -4516.8 to -3154.9]). The cumulative incidence of cancer, biopsy, mammogram, and MRI increased as risk category increased. In the observational cohort, 89% of participants (15&#x202f;980/18&#x202f;031) chose risk based. Risk-based breast cancer screening that includes population-based genetic testing safely stratified risk and screening intensity, but did not reduce biopsy rates.

Cases occurring through 2022 were followed up into 2023 for pregnancy conclusion and infant outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, with or without prior vaccination. COVID-19-associated hospitalization, critical care unit admission, and preterm birth. Of 26&#x202f;584 cases identified, 19&#x202f;899 cases were eligible for analysis. Among these, most infections occurred among those aged 30 to 35 years (46.3%) and among those of White race (55.9%). A total of 72% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14&#x202f;367) of cases were vaccinated and 28% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5532) were unvaccinated prior to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Among those vaccinated prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, 80% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11&#x202f;425) were vaccinated prior to pregnancy and 20% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2942) were vaccinated during pregnancy. Cases occurred during both Delta (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6120) and Omicron (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13&#x202f;799) variant time periods. Vaccination was associated with lower risk of hospitalization (Delta: relative risk [RR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.30-0.48]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 8.7% [95% CI, 7.3%-10.2%]; Omicron: RR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.27-0.53]; ARD, 3.8% [95% CI, 2.4%-5.2%]), critical care unit admission (Delta: RR, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.04-0.26]; ARD, 2.4% [95% CI, 1.8%-2.9%]; Omicron: RR, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.03-0.29]; ARD, 0.85% [95% CI, 0.27%-1.44%]), and preterm birth (Delta: RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.98]; ARD, 1.8% [95% CI, 0.3%-3.4%]; Omicron: RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.52-0.77]; ARD, 4.1% [95% CI, 2.0%-6.2%]). In multivariable analyses, vaccination was still associated with lower hospitalization risk in both variant time periods after controlling for comorbid conditions. In Omicron, compared with the vaccinated group, those unvaccinated had an adjusted RR of hospitalization of 2.43 (95% CI, 1.72-3.43). In Delta, those unvaccinated had an adjusted RR of hospitalization of 3.82 (95% CI, 2.38-6.14). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 prior to and during pregnancy, before COVID-19 diagnosis, was associated with a lower risk of severe maternal disease and preterm birth regardless of variant time period."

      "abstract_md": "Head and neck cancer, which arises in the lining or mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract, specifically the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, and paranasal sinuses, is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. In 2024, approximately 71&#x202f;110 individuals in the US were diagnosed with head and neck cancer, and it accounted for 16&#x202f;110 deaths. Approximately 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Worldwide, tobacco and alcohol use are the most prevalent risk factors. In the US and Europe, 60% to 70% of newly diagnosed oropharynx cancers (a subset of head and neck cancers) are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. At presentation, approximately 30% of patients with head and neck cancer have early-stage or localized disease (tumor &lt;4 cm without regional lymph nodes involvement), 60% have locoregionally advanced disease (tumor &#x2265;4 cm with local invasion and/or regional lymphadenopathy) and 10% have metastatic disease. Up to 10% of oropharynx squamous cell carcinomas present as squamous cell carcinomas of unknown primary. Standard treatment for localized head and neck cancer is surgery or radiotherapy, which are each associated with a 5-year overall survival rate of 70% to 90%. For locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer, multimodality treatment includes surgery followed by postoperative radiation with or without chemotherapy or concomitant chemotherapy (with cisplatin as the preferred agent), and radiation with surgery is reserved for persistent or recurrent disease. With these treatments for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer, 5-year overall survival rates are 25% to 60% and more than 80% for HPV-associated oropharynx cancer. Choice of treatment for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer should involve shared decision-making and consideration of effects on speech and swallow function and appearance. First-line treatment for patients with incurable locoregional recurrences or distant metastatic disease is immunotherapy with programmed death ligand-1 inhibition (ie, pembrolizumab) alone or in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. With treatment, patients with incurable locoregional recurrences or distant metastatic disease have a median survival of 12 to 15 months, and 5-year survival rates are less than 20%. Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. In the US and Europe, 60% to 70% of incident oropharynx cancers are associated with HPV infection. Standard treatment for localized head and neck cancer is surgery or radiotherapy. Locoregionally advanced disease is treated with surgery followed by radiation with or without chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation. First-line treatment for advanced disease is immunotherapy alone or with chemotherapy."

To determine whether referral to an exclusively artificial intelligence (AI)-led lifestyle intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is noninferior to referral to a human-led DPP in achieving recommended thresholds for weight loss, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, and weekly physical activity among adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity. This phase 3, parallel-group, pragmatic, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 11, 2021, to December 16, 2024 (last follow-up) at 2 US clinical sites in Baltimore, Maryland, and Reading, Pennsylvania. Adults 18 years or older with prediabetes and overweight or obesity were enrolled. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a referral to an AI-powered DPP lifestyle intervention delivered via a mobile app and Bluetooth-enabled digital scale or a referral to a human coach-led DPP lifestyle intervention delivered remotely. Both interventions were delivered independently of the study team over a 12-month period. The primary outcome was a composite of maintaining an HbA1c less than 6.5% throughout the study and achievement of at least 5% weight loss, at least 4% weight loss plus at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity (assessed with actigraphy), or an absolute reduction in HbA1c of at least 0.2 percentage points at 12 months. Noninferiority of referral to the AI-led DPP compared with referral to the human-led DPP was prespecified to be determined if the 1-sided 95% CI lower boundary of the risk difference did not cross -15%. A total of 368 participants were included (median [IQR] age, 58 [50-65] years; 71% were female, 27% were Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 61% were White; median [IQR] BMI, 32.3 [28.5-37.1]). After referral, 171 of 183 participants (93.4%) initiated the AI-led DPP and 153 of 185 (82.7%) initiated the human-led DPP. The primary outcome was achieved by 58 of 183 participants (31.7%) in the AI-led DPP group and 59 of 185 (31.9%) in the human-led DPP group (risk difference, -0.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -8.2%]), meeting the criterion for noninferiority. Findings were consistent across individual components of the composite end point and in sensitivity analyses. Among adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity, referral to a fully automated AI-led DPP was noninferior to referral to a human-led DPP in achieving a composite outcome based on weight reduction, physical activity, and HbA1c.

      "abstract_md": "Acute dysfunction of vital organs is the hallmark of critical illness. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the most widely adopted approach to describe organ dysfunction, has not been updated in 30 years and therefore may not appropriately capture current clinical practice and outcomes. To inform the data-driven component of an updated score (SOFA-2) in varied geographical and resource settings (stages 6-8) after expert input via a modified Delphi process (stages 1-5). A federated analysis was performed on data collected from adult patients admitted to 1319 intensive care units (ICUs) in 9 countries (Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Italy, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, United States) between 2014 and 2023. Four representative multicenter cohorts containing data from 2&#x202f;098&#x202f;356 patients were used for data-driven score development and internal validation. External validation was performed on 6 cohorts containing data from 1&#x202f;241&#x202f;114 patients. Content validity for organ dysfunction identified through the modified Delphi process should be reflected by predictive validity using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the score measured on the first ICU day (higher scores indicate worse organ dysfunction). Of 3.34 million patient encounters, 270&#x202f;108 (8.1%) died in the ICU (range, 4.5% to 20.5% across the 10 cohorts). SOFA-2 modified the 6 organ systems of the original SOFA score (brain, respiratory, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, hemostasis), including new variables and revised thresholds that better describe the organ dysfunction distribution from 0 to 4 points and their associated mortality (SOFA-2 AUROC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.81; SOFA-1 AUROC, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74-0.81). Evaluation of sequential SOFA-2 data from ICU day 1 to day 7 maintained its predictive validity. Insufficient data and lack of content validity precluded incorporation of gastrointestinal and immune dysfunction scores into SOFA-2. The SOFA-2 score, updated to include contemporary organ support treatments and new score thresholds, describes organ dysfunction in a large, geographically and socioeconomically diverse population of critically ill adults."

      "abstract_md": "Melanoma, the fifth most common cancer in the US, has increased from 8.8 per 100&#x202f;000 in 1975 to 28.42 per 100&#x202f;000 in 2022. Cutaneous melanoma comprises 94% of cases, with 104&#x202f;960 US cases projected for 2025. Cutaneous melanoma presents as a new, changing, or irregularly pigmented skin lesion. Cutaneous melanoma subtypes include superficial spreading (&#x2248;70%), lentigo maligna (&#x2248;15%), nodular (&#x2248;5%), desmoplastic (&#x2248;4%), amelanotic (2%-8%), spitzoid (&lt;2%), and acral (&#x2248;1%). Risk factors for cutaneous melanoma include UV radiation exposure, skin type (eg, skin that always burns, never tans), presence of benign and atypical nevi, and personal or family history of melanoma. Primary prevention consists of avoiding direct sunlight and indoor tanning, and photoprotection (sunscreen and sun-protective clothing). Based on United States Cancer Statistics data from 1999 to 2021, 77% of patients with cutaneous melanoma had localized disease (involving only the primary site), 9.5% had regional (nodal) disease, 4.7% had distant metastasis, and 8.8% were unstaged. Melanoma staging, which includes tumor thickness and ulceration and presence of lymph node or distant metastasis, ranges from stage 0 (melanoma in situ) to stage IV (distant metastasis). Localized melanoma (stage IA-IIA) is surgically excised, with margins of 0.5 cm to 2 cm based on depth of invasion. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended for cutaneous melanoma that is ulcerated or 0.8 mm or more thick. Following surgery, patients with stage IIB-C melanoma have improved recurrence-free survival with adjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or death, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49-0.79] for pembrolizumab and 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30-0.59] for nivolumab). For stage III disease, recurrence risk is decreased with nivolumab (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.86]), pembrolizumab (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.72]), or BRAF&#x2009;+&#x2009;MEK inhibitor therapy (dabrafenib&#x2009;+&#x2009;trametinib) (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.43-0.63]). First-line treatment for distant metastatic or unresectable melanoma is dual checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab. In 2017, 10-year melanoma-specific survival rates were 98% to 94% for stage IA-B, 88% to 75% for stage IIA-C, 88% for stage IIIA, 77% to 60% for stage IIIB-C, and 24% for stage IIID. In 2024, patients with distant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab had a 10-year overall survival rate of 43%. Melanoma is a common cancer in the US. Treatment for stage IA-IIA melanoma is surgical resection. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy after surgical excision improves recurrence-free survival in stages IIB-C melanoma. For stage III melanoma, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy or BRAF&#x2009;+&#x2009;MEK inhibitor therapy decreases risk of melanoma recurrence. First-line therapy for metastatic melanoma is dual checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab."

      "abstract_md": "Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water has been associated with increased chronic disease mortality. However, there is limited evidence on associations between reduced exposure and mortality risk. To examine whether reductions in arsenic exposure, measured using urinary arsenic levels, are associated with lower mortality from chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). A prospective cohort of 11&#x202f;746 adults was enrolled between 2000 and 2002 in Araihazar, Bangladesh, with levels of well-water arsenic ranging from less than 1 &#xb5;g/L to 864 &#xb5;g/L (mean, 102 &#xb5;g/L), exceeding the Bangladesh standard of 50 &#xb5;g/L. Arsenic levels declined over time as a result of community mitigation. Mortality was tracked through 2022. Analyses included 10&#x202f;977 participants with calculable changes in urinary arsenic levels. Urinary arsenic levels were measured up to 5 times per participant through 2018. Participants were categorized based on changes in urinary arsenic levels. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs for mortality from chronic diseases, including cancer and CVD. Among 10&#x202f;977 participants (57% female; mean age, 37.0 [SD, 10.1] years), mean urinary arsenic levels declined from 283 (SD, 314) to 132 (SD, 161) &#xb5;g/g creatinine from 2000 to 2018. Each IQR decrease in urinary arsenic (197 &#xb5;g/g creatinine) was associated with 22% lower chronic disease mortality (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.75-0.82]), 20% lower cancer mortality (aHR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.87]), and 23% lower CVD mortality (aHR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.81]). Time-varying Cox and restricted cubic spline analyses showed larger reductions were associated with lower mortality, while increases were linked to higher risk. Compared with participants with consistently high urinary arsenic levels (above the baseline median of 199 &#xb5;g/g creatinine [n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1757]), those whose levels declined below the median (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3757) had lower mortality from chronic diseases (aHR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.39-0.53]), including cancer (aHR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.35-0.73]) and CVD (aHR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.34-0.53]), similar to those consistently below the median (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4959) (aHR, 0.43-0.49). Findings were similar in propensity score-matched analyses. These findings support an association between reduced arsenic exposure and improved health outcomes in populations exposed to contaminated drinking water."

      "abstract_md": "Neuroscientific, epidemiological, and electronic health record studies implicate herpes simplex virus (HSV) as potentially etiological for Alzheimer disease (AD). To compare the efficacy and adverse effects of valacyclovir vs placebo in participants with early symptomatic AD and HSV seropositivity (HSV-1 or HSV-2). This randomized clinical trial included adults with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD or a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment with positive biomarkers for AD, a positive serum antibody test (IgG or IgM) for HSV-1 or HSV-2, and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 to 28. The trial was conducted at 3 US outpatient clinics specializing in memory disorders. Recruitment occurred from January 2018 to May 2022; the last follow-up occurred in September 2024. Either 4 g/d of valacyclovir (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) or matching placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60). The primary outcome was least-squares mean (LSM) change at 78 weeks in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive (ADAS-Cognitive) Subscale score (range, 0-70; higher scores indicate greater impairment). The secondary outcomes were LSM change in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Scale score; LSM change in the 18F-florbetapir amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR; higher scores indicate higher amyloid levels) for 6 brain regions (medial orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporal lobe, and precuneus); and LSM change in 18F-MK-6240 tau PET medial temporal SUVR (higher scores indicate higher tau levels) for 4 brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal, and parahippocampus). The frequency of adverse events was the safety outcome. Of the 120 participants (mean age, 71.4 [SD, 8.6] years; 55% were female), 93 (77.5%) completed the trial. At 78 weeks, the LSM change in the 11-item ADAS-Cognitive Subscale score was 10.86 (95% CI, 8.80 to 12.91) in the valacyclovir group vs 6.92 (95% CI, 4.88 to 8.97) in the placebo group, indicating greater cognitive worsening with valacyclovir than placebo (between-group difference, 3.93 [95% CI, 1.03 to 6.83]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). The LSM change in the ADCS-ADL Scale score at 78 weeks was -13.78 (95% CI, -17.00 to -10.56) in the valacyclovir group vs -10.16 (95% CI, -13.37 to -6.96) in the placebo group (between-group difference, -3.62 [95% CI, -8.16 to 0.93]). At 78 weeks, the LSM change in the 18F-florbetapir amyloid PET SUVR was 0.03 (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.10) in the valacyclovir group vs 0.01 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.08) in the placebo group (between-group difference, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.08 to 0.12]). The LSM change in the 18F-MK-6240 tau PET medial temporal SUVR at 78 weeks was 0.07 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.19) in the valacyclovir group vs -0.04 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.07) in the placebo group (between-group difference, 0.11 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.28]). The most common adverse events were elevated serum creatinine level (5 participants [8.3%] in the valacyclovir group vs 2 participants [3.3%] in the placebo group) and COVID-19 infection (3 [5%] vs 2 [3.3%], respectively). Valacyclovir was not efficacious with cognitive worsening for the primary outcome and it is not recommended to treat individuals with early symptomatic AD and HSV seropositivity.

To assess the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention for achieving self-reported continuous tobacco abstinence at 6 months, supported by biochemical verification at 6 months, compared with usual care in people with TB. Multicenter, cluster randomized clinical trial conducted between September 18, 2023, and January 2, 2025, randomizing (2:1) 27 TB clinics in Bangladesh and Pakistan to mHealth or usual care groups. The follow-up was 6 months. Participants were eligible if they were 15 years or older, had been diagnosed with drug-sensitive pulmonary TB in the past 4 weeks, smoked daily, were willing to quit, and had access to mobile phones. The mHealth group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;720) received text messages throughout TB treatment, daily for 2 months then monthly for 4 months, encouraging tobacco cessation. The usual care group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;360) received written information on tobacco cessation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous abstinence at 6 months, verified biochemically using carbon monoxide breath test at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported point abstinence at 9 weeks and 6 months, TB treatment adherence (days receiving TB treatment), TB treatment success (cured&#x2009;+&#x2009;completed treatment), TB treatment failure, TB treatment default (interruption of TB treatment for &#x2265;2 months), and death. Of 9232 patients assessed for eligibility, 1080 were randomized; most were male (mHealth, 96.9%; usual care, 95.8%), and 985 were retained throughout the trial (91%). For the primary outcome, 300 of 720 participants (41.7%) in the mHealth group demonstrated self-reported and biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months, compared with 55 of 360 (15.3%) in the usual care group (risk ratio, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.0-4.9]). In the mHealth vs usual care groups, respectively, mean TB treatment adherence was 174.3 (SD, 21.5) days vs 178.0 (SD, 12.1) days (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.23), and treatment success was 89.3% vs 85.6% (risk ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.9-1.6]). TB treatment failure (0.1% vs 0.5%) and default (3.1% vs 1.9%) were uncommon. Mortality was lower with mHealth (3.5%) vs usual care (7.5%) (hazard ratio, 0.4 [95%CI, 0.2-0.9]). An mHealth intervention was effective in achieving continuous abstinence in people with TB who smoked. mHealth is a feasible and effective intervention to help patients with TB quit smoking. isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN86971818."

      "abstract_md": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization in infants. The comparative effectiveness of 2 recently introduced preventive strategies (infant immunization through placental antibody transfer after maternal vaccination with the RSV prefusion F protein [RSVpreF] vaccine and passive infant immunization with nirsevimab) remains unknown. To compare the associations of maternal vaccination with the RSVpreF vaccine vs passive infant immunization with nirsevimab for the prevention of RSV-related hospitalization. This population-based cohort study used data from the French National Health Data System. Maternal vaccination with the RSVpreF vaccine occurred during 32 to 36 weeks' gestation among infants born in mainland France between September 1 and December 31, 2024. Passive infant immunization with nirsevimab occurred prior to hospital discharge. Infants were matched 1:1 by maternity ward discharge date, sex, gestational age, and region. Follow-up ended at the time of RSV hospitalization or death or on February 28, 2025. Maternal immunization with the RSVpreF vaccine and passive infant immunization with nirsevimab. The primary outcome was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection. The secondary outcomes included admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), admission to high-dependency unit, ventilator support, and oxygen therapy. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using conditional Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting. A total of 42&#x202f;560 infants (mean age, 3.7 [SD, 1.4] days; 51.7% male) were included in the study (21&#x202f;280 per group) with a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR, 70-99 days). Of the 481 hospitalizations for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, 212 (44.1%) occurred in the nirsevimab group vs 269 (55.9%) in the RSVpreF vaccine group (between-group difference, -11.8% [95% CI, -18.1% to -5.5%]). Compared with the RSVpreF vaccine, passive infant immunization with nirsevimab was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (adjusted HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88]). Compared with the RSVpreF vaccine, passive infant immunization with nirsevimab was associated with a lower risk of severe outcomes, including PICU admission (adjusted HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80]), requiring ventilator support (adjusted HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.81]), or requiring oxygen therapy (adjusted HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.81]). The results were consistent across subgroups and in the sensitivity analyses. Compared with maternal vaccination with the RSVpreF vaccine, passive infant immunization with nirsevimab was associated with lower risks of RSV-related hospitalization and severe outcomes. These findings reflect the first RSV season with use of these immunization strategies in mainland France; their use should be reevaluated in future studies."

      "abstract_md": "Since the start of the 21st century, more than 800&#x202f;000 firearm deaths and more than 2 million firearm injuries have occurred in the US. All categories of firearm violence-homicide, suicide, unintentional-result in reverberating harms to individuals, families, communities, and society. The collective responsibility of society is to safeguard the health and safety of its members, including from firearm harms. The JAMA Summit on Firearm Violence convened 60 thought leaders from a wide array of disciplines to chart an innovations roadmap that will lead to substantial reductions in firearm harms by 2040. The vision for 2040 is a country where firearm violence is substantially reduced and where all people and communities report feeling safe from firearm harms. The vision centers on practical solutions with an understanding of the country's constitutional protections for firearm ownership. Achieving the 2040 vision will require expansion of proven evidence-based strategies and the development of new, innovative approaches rooted in equity, accountability, and collective responsibility. Discussions centered on projecting a safer world, community violence interventions, technologic innovations, federal and state-level oversight of firearms, ethical considerations, and primordial prevention of firearm violence. The Summit charted a roadmap of 5 essential actions in the next 5 years to achieve this vision: (1) focus on communities and change fundamental structures that lead to firearm harms, (2) harness technological strengths responsibly, (3) change the narrative around firearm harms, (4) take a whole-government and whole-society approach, and (5) spark a research revolution on preventing firearm harms. A safer world will require investing in the discovery, implementation, and scaling of solutions that reduce firearm harms and center on the people and communities most affected by firearm violence."

Discontinuation of GLP-1RAs proximal to pregnancy could affect gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcomes. To compare gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcomes with and without exposure to GLP-1RAs before or during early pregnancy. Retrospective cohort study of 149&#x202f;790 singleton pregnancies delivered between June 1, 2016, and March 31, 2025, within a single academic health system. A GLP-1RA order between 3 years before and 90 days after conception, with propensity score matching of each exposed pregnancy to 3 unexposed pregnancies. The primary outcome was gestational weight gain. Secondary outcomes were excess gestational weight gain, large and small for gestational age birth weight, birth weight percentile for gestational age and sex, birth length, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Among 149&#x202f;790 pregnancies during the study period, 1792 (448 exposed and 1344 unexposed) were matched for the primary analysis. Exposed pregnancies had mean maternal age of 34.0 years (SD, 4.7 years) and prepregnancy body mass index of 36.1 (SD, 6.5; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); 378 of 448 (84%) had obesity and 104 of 448 (23%) had preexisting diabetes; 136 (30%) were Hispanic, 49 (11%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 223 (50%) were non-Hispanic White; and 43 (10%) had public insurance. The GLP-1RA-exposed pregnancies had greater gestational weight gain (mean, 13.7 kg [SD, 9.2]) than propensity score-matched unexposed pregnancies (mean, 10.5 kg [SD, 8.0]), a difference of 3.3 kg (95% CI, 2.3-4.2; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The GLP-1RA-exposed group had a higher risk of excess gestational weight gain (65% vs 49%; risk ratio [RR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.47), greater mean birth weight percentile (58.4% vs 54.8%; difference, 3.6%; 95% CI, 0.2%-6.9%), and higher risk of preterm delivery (17% vs 13%; RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.69), gestational diabetes (20% vs 15%; RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.68), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (46% vs 36%; RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49). There was no difference in birth length, risk of large or small for gestational age birth weight, or cesarean delivery. In a cohort composed primarily of women with obesity, GLP-1RA use with subsequent prepregnancy or early pregnancy discontinuation was associated with more gestational weight gain and a higher risk of preterm delivery, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."

Closed-loop insulin systems improve glycemia outside of pregnancy but have had limited testing in pregnancy. To assess the efficacy of a closed-loop system in pregnancy. Open-label trial enrolling pregnant women with type 1 diabetes at 14 clinical centers in Canada and Australia before 14 weeks' gestation with follow-up until 6 weeks postpartum. Enrollment occurred between June 2021 and July 2024 and follow-up was completed in March 2025. Participants were randomized 1:1 to closed-loop therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) or standard care (insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45) with continuous glucose monitoring. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in the pregnancy-specific glucose range (63-140 mg/dL), measured by continuous glucose monitoring from 16 to 34 weeks' gestation. Among 94 enrolled participants, 3 experienced pregnancy loss prior to randomization, 91 were randomized (mean age, 31.7 [SD, 5.2] years; early pregnancy hemoglobin A1c, 7.4% [SD, 1.0%]), and 88 were included in the primary analysis. The mean percentage of time spent in the pregnancy-specific glucose range from 16 to 34 weeks' gestation was 65.4% in the closed-loop group and 50.3% in the standard care group (mean adjusted difference, 12.5 [95% CI, 9.5-15.6] percentage points; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). There was 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia in the closed-loop group, and there were 2 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in the closed-loop group and 1 in the standard care group. Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using a closed-loop system spent significantly more time in the pregnancy-specific glucose range than those receiving standard care. These findings support the use of this closed-loop system in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04902378."

To evaluate the risk of death or major ischemic events within 90 days after a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy in patients at high risk of cardiac events who had undergone major vascular or general surgery operations and developed postoperative anemia. This parallel, single-blind, randomized clinical superiority trial included 1428 veterans (&#x2265;18 y) at high cardiac risk undergoing major vascular or general surgery operations. Participants were enrolled from February 2018 to March 2023 across 16 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the US. Seven hundred fourteen participants with postoperative hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL were randomized to a liberal strategy (transfusion trigger at hemoglobin level &lt;10 g/dL) and 714 to a restrictive strategy (transfusion trigger at hemoglobin &lt;7 g/dL). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, acute kidney failure, or ischemic stroke within 90 days after randomization. Secondary end points included a composite of cardiac complications other than myocardial infarction (arrhythmias, heart failure, and nonfatal cardiac arrest). Of the 1424 analyzed veterans (mean age, 69.9 [SD, 7.9] years; 1393 male [97.8%]; 268 Black [18.8%]; 48 Hispanic [4.1%]; 1071 White [75.2%]), 1297 (91.1%) underwent vascular surgical procedures. The mean hemoglobin difference between transfusion strategies was 2.0 g/dL on day 5 after randomization. The primary outcome rate in the liberal group was 9.1% (61 of 670) compared with 10.1% (71 of 700) in the restrictive group (relative risk, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.65-1.24). The secondary end point of cardiac complications without myocardial infarction, which was 1 of 5 secondary end points, occurred in 5.9% (38 of 647) of patients in the liberal group and 9.9% (67 of 678) of patients in the restrictive group (relative risk, 0.59; 99% CI, 0.36-0.98). After major vascular or general surgery operations among patients at high risk of a cardiac event, a liberal transfusion strategy did not reduce 90-day death or major ischemic outcome rates compared with a restrictive strategy.

      "abstract_md": "Low back pain (LBP) is influenced by interrelated physical, psychological, and social factors. However, most treatments focus on symptom reduction without addressing the underlying biopsychosocial needs of patients. To determine the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and clinician-supported biopsychosocial self-management vs medical care for adults with increased risk of chronic disabling LBP. This 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2 factorial randomized clinical trial enrolled participants in 3 research clinics at the Universities of Minnesota and Pittsburgh from November 2018 to May 2023; final follow-up was in June 2024. Adults with acute or subacute LBP at moderate to high risk of chronicity based on the STarT Back tool were randomized to 1 of 4 groups, with interventions lasting up to 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 2024 to June 2025. Spinal manipulation therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;201), supported self-management (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;305), or combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;193) compared with guideline-based medical care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;301). Physical therapists and chiropractors provided spinal manipulation and supported self-management. The 2 primary outcomes averaged over a follow-up of 1 year were monthly low back disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and weekly pain intensity (numerical rating scale). Secondary analysis examined the proportion of participants achieving a 50% or higher reduction in the primary outcome measures. Among the 1000 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 47 [16] years; 58% female), 93% completed the trial. The omnibus test for differences across the 4 treatment groups was statistically significant for disability (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001; supported self-management, 4.7; spinal manipulation, 5.5; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 4.8; medical care, 5.9) but not pain intensity (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.16; supported self-management, 2.8; spinal manipulation, 3.0; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 2.8; medical care, 3.0). Averaged over 12 months, LBP disability was significantly lower compared with medical care for supported self-management (mean difference, -1.2 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.5]) and supported self-management with spinal manipulation (mean difference, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.3]) but not spinal manipulation alone (mean difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4]). Group differences in pain intensity were not statistically significant; point estimates ranged from -0.2 to 0. Both supported self-management groups had higher proportions of patients achieving a 50% or greater reduction in disability (supported self-management, 67%; spinal manipulation, 54%; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 65%; medical care, 54%). For patients with acute or subacute LBP at increased risk of chronic disabling LBP, clinician-supported biopsychosocial self-management showed statistically significant but small reductions in disability, but not pain, vs medical care over 1-year follow-up, and spinal manipulation alone showed no significant difference for either outcome.

      "abstract_md": "Undertreated cancer symptoms are common among older adults, yet effective early identification and intervention remain limited. To determine whether lay health worker-led symptom assessment reduces acute care use among older adults with cancer. Multisite randomized clinical trial across 43 oncology clinics in California and Arizona conducted from November 2020 through October 2023 with 12 months of follow-up among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries aged 75 years or older with newly diagnosed, recurrent, or progressive cancer. Participants were randomized 1:1 into a symptom assessment group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200; usual care with lay health worker-led, telephone-based symptom assessments for 12 months using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System) or a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;216; usual care alone), with planned enrollment of 200 in both groups. The lay health workers reviewed assessments with advanced practice practitioners who conducted interventions for symptoms rated 4 or greater or that increased by 2 points or more. Outcomes were determined a priori. The primary outcome was emergency department (ED) use and hospitalizations. Secondary outcomes were total costs, hospice, and, among decedents, acute care within 30 days of death and facility deaths. Among 416 patients, the median age was 82 (range, 75-99) years; 219 (52.6%) were male; 171 (41.1%) had stage 4 disease; and 27 (6.4%) had recurrent disease. The mean risk adjustment factor score was 2.70 (SD, 1.77). Symptom assessment participants had 53% lower odds of ED use (61 [30.5%] vs 103 [47.7%] had &#x2265;1 ED visit; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.71), 68% lower odds of hospitalization (37 [18.5%] vs 86 [39.8%] had &#x2265;1 hospitalization; OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51), and lower mean total costs by $12&#x202f;000 per participant (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01) than control group participants. Among 142 deceased participants (71 in each group), symptom assessment participants had 68% lower odds of ED use within 30 days of death (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88) and 75% lower odds of acute care facility death (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.77). A lay health worker-led symptom assessment intervention may be a scalable approach to reduce acute care use. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04463992."
